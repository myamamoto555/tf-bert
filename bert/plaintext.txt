I was digging into the new Ink API's and found out that the Inking works well for both PC and Mobile.
But then i found out that when trying to recognize what I wrote, on PC it finds the necessary handwriting packages, (en-US etc) when developing we can set a default.
For Mobile the API finds nothing and there is no way to download any handwriting packages in the settings.
I tried both C# and vb.net

Windows Store Analitycs API is a powerful tool that allows developers to receive info about their apps faster but there's no info about developer revenue in IAP acquisition section.
Adding developer revenue or IAP price info to response will allow developers to receive accurate data about their income in requested period.

It is impossible to manage even a hanging indent because Paragraph lacks Margin and TextIndent properties.
However, hacking a hanging indent is not the real goal - general support for bulleting.
Build support for bullets and numbering into the Paragraph class with properties something like this
NumberStart int, -1 = inherit from previous run
NumberStyle enum {None, Bullet, Arabic, Letter, Roman}
NumberFlags enum flags {UpperCase, DottedLevels}
NumberLevel int
Make NumberStyle default to None and all this is non-breaking.

As a developer, I would like to have method to defer app deactivation/suspending in order to call async methods easily

Enjoyed these questions

You can't add/update/delete alarms or reminders from a BackgroundAgent.
It'd be great if we at least has the ability to change/edit reminders and alarms that were created by that app.

Missing ability to acquire audio jack properties such as jack colour.
I am migrating my app from Windows Desktop using "Core Audio API" to UWP using, hopefully, AudioGraph.
One of the problems I encounter is my inability to get Jack Info as in IKsJackDescription::GetJackDescription()

we would like be able to package multiple apps developed by our organisation into a single downloadable package, so we can put a prize on the complete package, something similar to the apple iOS 8 app bundle.

From time to time, our university also likes to submit applications which are in most of the cases not fully grown products but tech demos or prototypes.
However, there is no category for publishing apps in such a category and most of the users react unintelligibly and give bad reviews as they expect a fully grown product.
A demo or prototype category like it exists on Android would solve this issue.

Please provide APIs for call forwarding and other call management functions(hold/unhold,swap,conference,etc)

The ToastNotification object has a convenient ExpirationTime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period.
Unfortunately, the ScheduledToastNotification, which is just a ToastNotofcation but "scheduled", lacks this helping feature.
This makes me, as a developer, scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not-so-relevant-anymore notifications in their action center.
Thank you.

I want to drap items from one treeview to another treeview.
I want to use this control TreeView from this link https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tree-view.
Whenever i drag control from one treeview to another treeview it throws exception.
How to use this control as drag and drop item between treeviews.

A Control for selecting an Emoji that works like the DatePicker control and a Flyout for selecting an Emoji that works like the DatePickerFlyout flyout.

It would be awesome if some properties like ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView().TitleBar.BackgroundColor accepts a Brush instead of color.
Brushes are everywhere in UWP except this aspect

The copyFolderAsync method is missing in WinRT for some non-obvious reason.
See my example implementation here:
http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/7aeb4791-3f5b-4e18-93be-0b6191cf6b72/code-snippet-storagefoldercopyfolder-method?forum=winappswithhtml5

Now I have to GetScheduledToastNotifications() and delete every single one of them separately (and it doesn't performs well).
I would like to have the ability to delete all of Scheduled Toast Notifications with one built-in method which won't affect performance of my app.
It would be nice if I could add simple switch in settings to let user turn ON/OFF notifications (which is done by deleting existing ones).

I hope everyone can publish fonts on the store

I have seen api recording and streaming and previewing the capture from the video.
Streaming works well with previewing, but how about being able to do streaming and recording to a file at the same time?


This will greatly improve developing for the windows store app, which requires you to associate your VS project to an app.
For large teams, just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision.

Needs improvement

Changing from one subscription IAP to another (for instance, upgrading from a monthly to yearly IAP) is listed as not yet supported.
Quote from:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/monetize/enable-subscription-add-ons-for-your-app
"Customers cannot switch subscription periods using the http://account.microsoft.com/services page for their Microsoft account.
To switch to a different subscription period, customers much cancel their current subscription and then purchase a subscription with a different subscription period from your app."
Can this ability please be added.

Winjs was designed prior to ES6.
Some of the capabilities are now provided by ES6 such as classses would not have to be provided by winjs.
Winjs could be modernized, streamlined and simplified as part of the open source project by providing only that functionality not now supported by ES6.
Edge Browser, VS 2015 and VS Code already provides support for ES6.
For older browser that do not fully support ES6, the code could be transpiled into ES5 by babeljs, traceur, etc.

Packaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge, however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps, even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects.
It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally, it can only access a limited set of COM objects; however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge, it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge, using the technical described in the blog above.
Without this support, if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win32 app exposes out-of-proc COM objects, the only way UWP app can communicate with the win32 app is through AppService.
This brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win32 app, and sometimes it is impossible if win32 source code is not available.
Allowing UWP access packaged COM will eliminate this overhead, allow simpler architecture, and allow re-use much more traditional win32 apps.

When you have compiled bindings (x:Bind) that have the interface IDisposable implemented or inherited the Roslyn System.Runtime.CSharp.Analyzers reports that the fields are not properly disposed of.
While this could be also a fix for Roslyn System.Runtime.CSharp.Analyzers, the generated Bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings.

The following page https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/ does not work in IE.
I cannot expand FAQ entries and so on.
The page above also recommends me to set up the MS Edge.
The MS Edge is incompatible with my LTSB system.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/hardware-and-software-requirements .
My idea is either to fix the Internet (I have problems not only with https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/ but with some other sites too -- GitHub warns me to update too) or the MS LTSB systems (personally I am interested in MS Windows Server 2016).
Thank you.

We've had our tax profiles rejected over and over again, without ever knowing what could be wrong.
Clearly, "Your tax profile is not valid."
is not much of a useful error message.
Even our tax adviser finally had no idea how to deal with that.
We had to go through Symantec tech support chat, Microsoft tech support chat, and finally Windows Store support chat who had to look up the error for a few days in order to finally get an idea what's wrong.
Suggestion: Show exactly that error message in the Windows Store dashboard.

Imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call, the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him/her.
This is a missing feature since windows mobile.

Hello, I want to protect some user-mode code and read only data against other user-mode modification from a kernel-mode driver, while allowing process handle creation.

I think Microsoft should add a new property to FontIcon that combines "FontFamily" and "Glyph" into a single Uri Property, call it "GlyphUri".
(Example:  GlyphUri="ms-appx:///Fonts/MyFont.ttf?glyph=A")
And when you type GlyphUri in the VS XAML Editor and type equal sign, it pops up an opinions menu to open a "FontIcon Wizard".
If you open the FontIcon Wizard, it looks similar to the old Windows "CharMap" Application, Except it also has an extra button called "Manage Fonts",  When you click it you get a Font Management Page that lets you "Add New Font" from your harddisk,  "Download a New Font" from nuget...etc...
When you select either on, it automtically adds the font to a Folder under your project called "Fonts" that you can specify using a ms-appx resource path...
Further, I think nuget should maintain a set of "tags" on all their properties, one of these tags should be "Font-Icons", so that when you click "Download New Font" its going to search nuget for this "Font-Icon" tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular...
Also, I think NuGut, should maintain User Comments for each package...and a 4 star rating...so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing....

If you have no more disk space; the install crashed.
After that, you have a BSOD in loop ... You have to refresh your computer.

Let's say there is a app which display news stories.
The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand.
The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.
These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).
Now let's say next day, the app is opened again.
App immediately displays yesterday's news stories and works in background to load new stories (or user pulls to refresh).
As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView, not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.
Now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache/disk.
This is a very common scenario for many apps and it would be great if we can get something similar in combination of Incremental Loading Collection.
With proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved.
I believe it would a very good addition to the library

Improve its data base and functionality.
Market it more as a visual assistant.
Ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see.
Scan it and Bing Vision give u a list of the nearest theatres and show times, or post a reminder in your calendar.
You see a ad for a pair a shoe you want.
Scan it and Bing Vision give you a list of the nearest store that have them in stock.

Our desktop application displays a dialog using the GetOpenFileName API function, access to the Network Drive may fail.
There is no problem when accessing by computer name.

If you have a WinForms app you remain stuck even with Store the bridge for the store.
In practical terms you are forced to make a UI technology diversion  to implement new functionality.
Xaml doesn't look a tempting option because not useful for mobile or web and needed controls usually implemented in javascript first
At a application architectural level, porting WinForms to HTML/JS favours an entirely new application which follows an understood/accepted architectural pattern, then re-implement old functionality.
New UI design -&gt; New Training Materials -&gt; new Deployment strategy.
So imagine the app in question, was one written by an ex-employee in 2008 in VB.Net with deep domain-knowledge targeting users with similar domain knowledge, for a specialist task with no design documentation beyond a description of a manual process it replaced.
Well this is the norm... and for all it's wrong's its there.
Never had budget assigned in the first place, and it's used by 10 people who are all busy.
This application never moves...unless the organisation restructures in order to make that possible, or some new employee with domain knowledge just gets the inspiration to write a new better one.
Given the architectural barrier is the killler, I don't believe there is any feature of GDI+ which cannot be expressed in HTML.
the UI may not adhere to good gui design principals, it's performance may suck but it probably won't.
But it's users can start it, and it will look and act the same as it did before arcane controls and all.
The architecture of a Modern HTML5 appliication has much more in common with GDI+ and a windows message loop than it does with Xaml.
Things like Redux essentially go out of their way to be like a message loop to avoid race conditions through async operations.
For Microsoft this would I believe solve a massive developer stumbling block even allowing Winforms controls to potentially be integrated in HTML UI's.
Even the original CLR System.WinForms implementation would not need any code changes as these would all be shimmed at the GDI+ layer and wouldn't as a result be able to tell the different between being GDI+ rendered or HTML rendered.

When we set password lock for the main screen, the same password is used in the Kids corner.
Either allow to set a different password or remove the password of it like it was before in WP8.0.
The kids using the phone should not be using the main user password.

In Windows Phone 8.1, and option in Cortana's settings allows the User to receive notification when it is time to go to work.
If the User does not have a consistently timed work routine, they may notice that Cortana will continue to notify the User using the first work pattern recognized by Cortana.
The User can self-resolve by wiping Cortana.
Note:  More information may be required to reproduce this issue.
Phone Model: US Version Nokia Lumia Icon (929)
OS Found: 8.10.14157.200
Repro rate: Unknown.
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Enable Cortana on WP8.1
2.
Press the search key and enter Cortana's notebook by pressing the icon in the upper left corner of the screen.
3.
Select Interests &gt; Traffic and ensure that the bottom box is checked.
4.
Repeatedly commute to the same location at the sane time (original start time was 8:30 AM when issue occurred) until Cortana learns this scheduling.
5.
No longer return to that location and time, instead commute normally (5:30 PM on initial occurrence).
6.
Observe that Cortana continues to use original commute until memory is wiped.


As for now the PictureDecoder can only decode JPG and run on the UI thread.
I am especially thinking about tile generation on background agents : I'd like to have an enriched PictureDecoder able to run on any thread and decode PNG as well.

When you're deploying Windows Store App to a remote device, it says in the output window:
1&gt;Creating a new clean layout...
1&gt;Copying files: Total 205 mb to layout...
And then, at least for me it takes from 60 seconds to 20 mins, until it gets deployed.
Can some additional information be outputed?
Like for ex., can you output upload speed every second?
This would be very useful, in determining, why sometimes upload is slow

var RoamingFolder = ApplicationData.Current.RoamingFolder;
var folder = await RoamingFolder.CreateFolderAsync("AmazingFolder", CreationCollisionOption.OpenIfExists);
The second line will execute fine when running on Windows 10, but try to do it on Windows 10 Mobile, it will crash with a "E_AccessDenied"
Folks at StackOverflow have speculated that on Windows 10 Mobile, the RoamingFolder is a virtual folder, and thus has limitations versus Windows 10.
Could we either be allowed to create folders in RoamingFolder, or have it not be allowed to simplify the cross platform support?

When I set Center with property or with TrySetViewAsync, map changes altitude based on height of the object below

Also I can't get a full 2D map which is what I desire but no matter what I do the buildings are 3D

Hello,
on Windows 10 UWP apps, if you rapidly click or unintentionally double-click on any control supporting click/tapped event, its associated Click event handler will execute for each.
This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.
For example, if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command, an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog, which causes an exception, if not handled will result in a crash of the application.
In my opinion, developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control.
We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler

It would be really nice to have a "Share" task that I could pass a stream to, in order to share an image.
This task could bring up the same interface when I share an photo from my pictures library.
It would make it simple to share photos to facebook and twitter if the user already has it setup.
It would also make it possible to finally share photos via sms and email programmatically.

Developers need a way of sharing data between applications.
1.- Check if an ApplicationID is installed/purchased
2.- Share files between applications in something that could be called "SharedStorageFiles" instead of "IsolatedStorageFiles".
3.- Share variables between applications in something that could be called "Desharrapamientos" instead of "IsolatedStorageSettings".
4.- Check for pinned ActiveTiles (not modify them, just check if an ApplicationID primary or secondary tile is already pinned)

It would be nice to be able to delete a cert you have uploaded.

In Silverlight it was once possible to register an app as an option for the edit picker in the photo hub (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj662932(v=vs.105).aspx).
This is not possbile for UAP apps.
Another, even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an "open with..."-option in the built-in photos app.
This option is already present in the desktop variant of the app, but missing in the mobile app.

Some of our use cases require geofences e.g.
when entering/leaving a state or reaching city limits.

I can't register dev account because of living in Republic of Moldova.

We use Microsoft Expression Encoder to do live, smooth streaming, video feeds.
I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
&lt;video src="http://mlmidev.webcastcenter.com/mlm/idev.isml/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
It works on iOS, Android 3+, and Apple computers with Safari.
Since this is a Microsoft technology (or, at least, I thought it was), I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone 8.
I can use a Silverlight player program (BitGravity Player is what I'm currently using), but it requires me to type an address in.
It's just one area that I can't recommend Windows Phones to people.
I used to be able to recommend Windows Mobile phones, because we used Windows Media Streaming Server and it had Windows Media Player.

We use MediaComposition to generate thumbnails for mp4 video files.
It's working great on physical machines.
But on virtual machines we get a InvalidCastException.
It's happening on multiple different virtualizers (Parallels, VirtualBox, ...).
Here is a small testing UWP app:
I've also posted the full exception there.

From the build 17711, Windows.ApplicationModel.AppService.AppServiceConnection.OpenAsync() consistently returns 'Unknown Error'.
I've tried this sample but not a luck.
https://github.com/Microsoft/DesktopBridgeToUWP-Samples/tree/master/Samples/AppServiceBridgeSample/cs
The unknown error also happens on build 17713 and I'm curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release?

It doesn't increase the wish to develope the product.
Where can I vote for showing sales up to limit 200 USD?

This could allow for quite a few scenarios - someone is currently locked in with a carrier that doesn't have WP7 phones available.
They could actually purchase apps on the Marketplace and use them.
Enable a "code-once" and runs on Windows or Phone.

Using Resources in a DataTemplate worked just fine before.
Now that I've upgraded to Anniversary and installed the newest SDK and Tools + the newest Visual Studio Update it doesn't work as expected at all.
If I have a datatemplate like this:
&lt;DataTemplate x:Key="SomeDataTypeItemTemplate" x:DataType="data:Type"&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Grid.Resources&gt;
            &lt;vm:ViewModel x:Key="MyViewModel" Item="{x:Bind}"/&gt;
        &lt;/Grid.Resources&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text="SomeText" Visibility="{Binding IsVisible, Converter={StaticResource VisibleWhenTrueConverter}, Source={StaticResource MyViewModel}"&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
This will crash on instantiation because somehow the ViewModel object is null when the Bindings are updated which was definitely not the case in previous versions and surely not the expected behavior.
If I replace the x:Bind with a Binding it will run but if using the datatemplate for multiple objects for example in a GridView the resource will have the same value for all instances which makes it really pointless.

To be able to make a movie (and share it with the rest of the World via youtube) we need an ability to generate MPEG4/WMV stream/file by utilizing hardware codecs (through FileSink).
Also some way to change (enhance) audio/video captured from mic/camera before it will be encoded and saved into file.

Please add api's for sharing to reading list.
It is a useful feature.
Would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs.

Most DataGrids have readily available ComboBoxColumn where data can be changed to a value from a given collection.
In view mode it looks like the normal TextColumn, and in edit mode the ComboBox appears.
While it is possible to achieve this with the TemplateColumn having a ComboBoxColumn would be more convenient.

The link to the PrinterExtensionLibrary for UWP points to 8.1.

Instead it takes you to 8.1.
Is that be design?


Just like the picture/music extras to be able to integrate in a persons/phone numbers(unkown caller))
So to add phone services to easy search for numbers or To be able to start a "contact/message" app from the contact card.

For .NET 4.5 and Windows Store apps it is posible to generate Task-based asynchronous operations when we add a Service Reference to the project.
That is still not possible for Windows Phone projects, and we have to handle with completed event based asynchronous operations.
Task-based operations would make the code much more clean and readable.

It would be great if the Splitview is swipeable without coding.

There is a bug when calling KeQueryMaximumProcessorCountEx(0)
The bug reproduces in the following case:
The bug happens in the following situation
Specific OS: Windows 2008 R2 Datacenter Edition.
Must be running as a VM.
Dynamic Hardware Partitioning must be enabled (in ESX this feature is called CPU Hot-Plug).
The hypervisor (ESX host) must have MORE THAN 64 CPUs (and when it has between 128 and 255 CPUs, a bluescreen is guaranteed).
The guest (Win2008) must have AT MOST 64 vCPUs.
The problem seems to be, in the case of CPU hot-plugging enabled, this function confuses the fact that it needs to get a maximum count with looking at the active group count.
This can happen in large virtualized envs, as mentioned above and apparently, was already found and fixed since in Windows 2012 R2 (and, I am guessing, also Windows 2012 RTM, but we didn't look at it), this bug was fixed.

Developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app.
Something that android and iOS developers can.
I can't believe that we are in 2015 and we don't have something like that.
There would be great apps in the store that users would love.

Problems :1) MediaPlayer class play audio will delay 1-2s.
.
2) Audio file length less than 1 or 2 s will not playing.
Since mobile build 10586 released, I found an  English leaning app  Bing dictionary(https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh63sw0&amp;geoMarket=cn) couldn't play words timely, when you  click  the play button,you have to wait 1-2 second then the word come out.First I thought this might be some application bug itself,but  when i realized Bing dictionary was not the only one app facing this problem.
So i did some research, I decompile one of those app, and found it used MediaPlayer class for playing audio file,then I wrote a demo and the same problem did occur.
But I don't have enough evidence to prove that.
It will be great appreciated that anyone see this will help me vote it up so Microsoft can aware and  fix it,it is really important for those who  learning English and looking up vocabularies frequently in daily life.
Thank you very much.

Obviously, I need to consider the different device models but that would be a task for me.

Until Windows [Phone] 8.1 this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work.
Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots.
My thought: Using simulator, while on a page, a one-click button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports.
Then, I navigate to another page, press the button and it take N screenshots again, one for each language.
In the upload website, a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once.

Right now it's possible to define "apps for websites using app URI handlers".
In these handlers it's possible to define excledePaths - which URIs should not be handled by app.
These excludePaths feature supports only path matching right now, not wildcards for the whole Uri.
We'd appreciate support for more generic excludePaths for any query, like: *&amp;timeboard=*

It might be necessary to ensure the downloaded base images are not corrupted, and it would be very nice for you to provide them.
Thanks!

I got a lot of ideas but because I got no lots of money to aquire one developer account so I cannot publish an app to Windows Phone or Windows store.
Hope that Microsoft (if possible), allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store.
With this, maybe it can attract more developers to publish an app on these two platforms of Microsoft specially to upcoming Windows10.
Hope that this is possible.

I am targeting Windows 10 version 1809 and that is also my OS version.
If I have an AppBarButton inside a CommandBar and set the Flyout of the AppBarButton to a MenuFlyout then it doesn't work properly - the MenuFlyout opens Ok, but it doesn't block the background and it's impossible to close it without clicking a MenuItem in the MenuFlyout (even clicking on the AppBarButton to try and close it doesn't work).
This used to work fine before version 1809.
Perhaps something got broken when the new CommandBarFlyout that's been added in 1809 was introduced.
A workaround is to set the button's FlyoutBase.AttachedFlyout property instead and manually open the flyout on click, but this is a bit cumbersome, especially having to change all existing instances of this.

In the Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication namespace, there is an `internal` interface named ISerialDevice.
I can see it when I "go to definition" on SerialDevice.
SerialDevice implements ISerialDevice.
In order to break my code's dependency on actual hardware so I could automate my tests, I had to reinvent the wheel.
By keeping this interface internal, I was forced to re-create the interface (mostly) and create a wrapper around SerialDevice that implemented it.
That's a lot of code to write when the interface already exists.
I'm sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration.

As developer I want to create custom picker like Date or Time pickers

We've heard a lot about the default experiences in the phone (especially the different hubs) are a great resources for developers and designers to get a feel for some real world implementations of the Metro Design Language and get inspired from them.
However, not everybody has a physical device, so having those experiences in the emulator would be a great addition to the dev tools and resources.

It seems that animated GIFs disappear when application minimizes / restores.
This is reproducible in the XamlAnimatedGif sample app on Win 10 Desktop.
Platform Version - 10.0.14393.0
To reproduce:
1.
Run app.
2.
Notice animated GIFs appear.
3.
Minimize app.
Wait 10 seconds.
4.
Restore app.
At least one of the animated GIFs will disappear.
Eventually, they all disappeared for me.

In Windows 10 Mobile, any third-party app can act as a Caller-ID app to intercept the call and set the PhoneCallOrigin.
But other apps cannot access PhoneCallOrigin from PhoneCallHistoryEntry.

While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader, the progress updates every 1MB, which is not really accurate.
I've noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms.
It would be better if it was as fast as the WebClient class used in a desktop application

The RadialGauge control needs a ValueChanged event to enable apps to tie to it and become more event-driven.

Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen, to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.

Right now we can't show progress on the taskbar for example to let a user see the current status of a download or something else.
Media player buttons are possible in the taskbar but why not the progressbar?

We need the ability for developers to add relevant tags to their app descriptions, we then need the ability to search for apps with those tags, tags should also be verified during app submission to ensure theyre relevant
dont know about anyone else but im fed up of the marketplace being swamped with total rubbish, it would be nice to see apps that im interested in instead of a thousand apps that i have no interest in

As a user, I would like to be able to ask Cortana 'when is John Smith's (for example) birthday?'

I need to write to a bitmap which is very painful (imagine a vnc client for example) on windows phone right now, so please support the Copy- and WritePixels methods and some others.

How can we ensure registration is complete for the COM server without adding regsvr32 command in post build and setting linker value for xe2x80x9cRegister Outputxe2x80x9d to false.
We can see the entries added in the registry, but client cannot access the interfaces.
We see an error CLASS_NOT_REGISTERED message.

i am currently developing a blueooth universal app for phone and windows.
but the bluetooth api for phone and windows are still quite different for example, the GattCharacteristicUuids (
https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/45849dcd-d27b-49df-8705-7d419a7b08f5/static-gattcharacteristicuuids-differs-from-wp-and-windows?forum=wpdevelop#83613e3e-b475-42a1-bf6a-2f27905e933d
2. the xaml code and controls are quite different from windows and phone, I want the app for phone will directly running on windows, not concern about differences between controls and such, like android and ios.


Launcher.LaunchFolderAsync should accept a StorageFile as first argument.
Sometimes I only have a StorageFile and I would like to launch the Explorer to display that file.
To do so, I need access to the file's StorageFolder and pass that to LaunchFolderAsync.
However, I usually don't have the permission to access the StorageFolder and StorageFile.GetParentAsync() returns null.
Please enhance LaunchFolderAsync to accept any IStorageItem (file or folder) as the first argument.

Would be nice if you could drag your file from the Project Tree over to a Xaml property requiring an "ms-appx:///" path and it would expand to an ms-appx:/// path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem?
example:
      &lt;BitmapIcon UriSource="ms-appx:///Assets/icon/1.png"/&gt;
getting the ms-appx path correct and not mistyped is a serious pain in the neck...  that's why Microsoft should let people drag and drop them from their project tree in ms-appx path format....

Me and two friends of mine created an app that won in a Windows Hackathon held by Microsoft Cyprus.
We actually won the Hackathon without finishing our app due to limitations of Windows phone API.
We need some sort of API to automatically send an SMS.
The reason for it to be automatic is because this is for cases when the owner of the phone is unable (asleep or something similar) to do so.
If you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this API would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent.
Also apps like these must be forced to get access from the user on their first run to send SMS on their own.
Their are many ways to keep the security under check and still provide this functionality

Web view crash with too long URIs
When redirecting from a webpage to a non supported URI that is longer than 2084 characters the Webview will crash without the throwing any exception.
The weird part about this is that if you redirect the webview to a URI starting with http:// or https:// or you send it to a malformed URI (someting:aLotOfText) of the same length it will be able to handle it.
Example repository:
https://github.com/jeroen1602/UWPWebviewCrash

La mayorxc3xada de las aplicaciones estxc3xa1n en ingles, muchas limitan sus capacidades.

xbox dev mode companion work ipv6 please...

Allow app to launch URI with http schema in default video or audio player (not only store player, win32 apps support will be great).
Now in current API if try to open http-URI with Launcher.LaunchUriAsync and option { ContentType = "video/mp4" }, it will opened in default web-browser.

In the usage statistics, I don't want to care about the specific releases of my app, and that makes the chart really weird, with more than one value for each point in time (most notable in months).
A single line should go through all the months regardless of the release, or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off.

When undertaking an app store search on Windows Phone, I only see the top 50 apps from my search.
The Windows Phone Store has thousands of apps to choose from.
But I'll never see most of these with such a limited search range.
I realise I can search through the WP store on my PC.
But like many others, I generally search on my phone when looking for a phone app.
Other platforms provide a huge search range, covering hundreds of apps.
Please expand your search range to at least the top 100-200 apps.
Thanks  :)

With the merger it could take advantage of the HTML user's legacy and accelerate development in XAML or WPF.
Another advantage is the developer already have a preview in design mode
Could do something like:
&lt;!-- XAML first --&gt;
&lt;Grid&gt;
  &lt;!-- HTML after --&gt;
  &lt;table style='...'&gt;
        &lt;tr style='...'&gt;
              &lt;td style='...'&gt;My teste here&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;/tr&gt;

 I am a professional software engineer and I am developing with Visual Studio at work, So I thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone, because I could develop some phone applications.
But now I realized that before I can test any application on my phone, I have to pay 99 $.
I think this will be the wrong way.
So I think it would be better to sell the windows phone and by a android phone, where I haven't to pay to develop applications.
I could understand that I have to pay, if I will distribute applications with the app-shop,

Platform should support new applications that are not big companies'.
In these days all new applications don't appear in New+Rising category, and some new applications are dying.
We have communicate with Microsoft Support about this situation and they said "We don't promise "New applications always enter New+Rising category" to developers.
It is so embarrassing for small companies or freelance developers.
You should support new applications, you should support us.

Support the last version of Net Standard 1.6.
Developing desktop apps for UWP is subpar as many API are not present like SqlClient.
Microsoft is loosing a huge market by not supporting a full net standard.
Net standard should be used by UWP and not limited by it.

It is up to the parents what apps they decide to share from the Main Phone to Kids Corner, regardless of the capabilities of the app.
Currently if you want to use a task that is regularly blocked in Kid's Corner, like Phone Call Task - you are displayed a message that indicates that you are not able to use that functionality.
My use case, as a parent, is that I really donxe2x80x99t want to give the kids a full functioning smart phone, I donxe2x80x99t want them dialing random people, I'd like to keep them in Kid's Corner.
Ixe2x80x99d like to give them the ability to xe2x80x9cCall Homexe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cCall Momxe2x80x9d, etc.
where I can control who they call, thatxe2x80x99s why I wanted to create and share an application in Kid's Corner to allow me to accomplish this.
This feature, as well as the feature here http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3326985-no-pin-option-for-kids-corner would work in conjunction with one another to accomplish this use case.

I need support for ios, the actual app, has a lot of problems

See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39767527 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/39768462
You can also use https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/DatagramSocket to demonstrate this issue.
Use scenario 5 to listen for multicast traffic and observe nothing is received until after hitting the send button.

Many functions in the Windows API are offered in both Unicode and ANSI variants - for example, CreateFileW and CreateFileA - and the header sets a preprocessor define CreateFile that resolves to one of the two based on whether UNICODE is defined.
This means that any file which includes windows.h is getting these macros dumped into the global namespace - which causes problems if we want to have a function named 'CreateFile' in our own code (even in our own namespaces/classes).
We'd be much happier if we could just avoid defining these macros entirely, to avoid any possible issues.
We're OK with having our own code specify the ANSI or Unicode variant explicitly.

It's annoying having to download and install the toolkit separately.

Support the Windows.Media.Editing API on Windows 8.
Currently it is supported on Windows Phone only.

Currently, if Cortana launches an app, the app knows that Cortana launched it, and if the launch was via speech or text.
Great stuff.
Now, since Cortana does this already, please pass us the parsed NLP string, with identified pronouns, with grammatical breakdown.
This must already be done anyway, so just give it us so that we can gain the advantage of its use without having to create the same in our apps.
Pronoun identification alone would give us so much context, but grammatical breakdown would also assist.
This would put Windows so far above the competition it isn't funny, and should already be available (we already see that breakdown when we speak strings in the near-realtime parsing feedback)
Thanks, a loyal Windows developer.
(fellow devs, please vote for this one)

ApplicationViewWindowingMode Enum
For my work app, we wanted the app to launch maximised.
The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.
Auto give little control over the first launch of the app.
This meant that I ended up using PreferredLaunchViewSize during first launch and then Auto on subsequent launches.
This is what I am currently using
var currentAppView = ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView();
currentAppView.SetDesiredBoundsMode(ApplicationViewBoundsMode.UseVisible);
var di = Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.GetForCurrentView();
var size = new Size(di.ScreenWidthInRawPixels, di.ScreenHeightInRawPixels);
size.Height -= 100;
size.Width -= 100;
ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchViewSize = size;
ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchWindowingMode = ViewModelLocator.AppSettingsInstance.WindowSizeSet ?
ApplicationViewWindowingMode.Auto : ApplicationViewWindowingMode.PreferredLaunchViewSize;
ViewModelLocator.AppSettingsInstance.WindowSizeSet = true;
This seems a bad way to manage window size.
Can we please improve the situation by adding missing API
* Maximize
* Minimize
* Dock window to left or right

hi, there SaveRingtoneTask that works very well with Silverlight applications to add audio files as a ringtone.
But there is no way to add audio files as a ringtone on a Windows Universal app.
However, users like the idea of personalizing their ringtones smartphone.

- Audio is running in the background using the single-process model.
- Then audio is paused.
- Then the phone goes into standby, causing the app to be suspended.
- Turning on the phone, being on the lock screen, using the volume knobs, the SystemMediaTransportControls show up.
- Using the buttons on the SystemMediaTransportControls nothing happens.
- But when unlocking the phone all buttons hit previously are executed properly.
Unfortunately this also affects Bluetooth devices that are connected (like the car's audio system, or a headphone).
As soon as the app is suspended the MediaPlayer doesn't react anymore to any input... until the phone is unlocked.

Currently, you can only have the review page from the app list with the contextual menu.
It will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general prxc3xa9sentation, screenshots &amp; the other users reviews

Silverlight 5 enables you to debug data bindings by setting breakpoints on bindings in XAML.
When a breakpoint is hit, you can use the Locals window to examine the state of a binding and identify any issues.
For more information, see Data Binding.
Silverlight 5 also includes several data binding enhancements, some of which were previously available only in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
These enhancements enable you to do the following:
Use data bindings with styles.
To do this, use the Setter.Value property as a binding target.
You will typically do this in XAML using the binding markup extension.
Bind to ancestors in the visual tree.
To do this, set the Binding.RelativeSource property to FindAncestor.
Associate bound objects to data templates implicitly by type instead of explicitly by template name.
To do this, set the DataTemplate.DataType property for each implicit template instead of specifying x:Key values.
Bind to dynamically-generated properties.
To do this, implement the ICustomTypeProvider interface on classes with dynamic properties.
The FrameworkElement.DataContextChanged event has been added.
You can use this event to detect when the data context for an element has changed.
The UpdateSourceTrigger.PropertyChanged enumeration value has been added.
This indicates to update the binding source whenever the binding target value changes.
This can be helpful when the binding target is a TextBox.
You can detect changes before the TextBox loses focus.
Also, you do not have to handle the TextChanged event, which better supports the MVVM pattern.

Hi, Microsoft.Phone.Scheduler.Reminder class currently has a default reminder tone, which cannot be overriden and I think it's a limitation, as you cannot have your phone vibrate at a particular time, using Reminder.
It will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when you're in a meeting.
At times, you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket, still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud, when you don't want it to.
Thanks!

message center icon keep showing 99 new messages even i see the messages

DatePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user's input.
And along with that it should have place holder text like all the other controls do.

The TabView uses 2 RepeatButtons for the back and forward actions when size is to big to fit in current host container.
Would be nice if we could supply our own Segoe MDL2 asset values for those buttons on the TabView control, so that we do not need to override the ScrollView style supplied with the toolkit.

Currently WP8.1 Apps don't support service references.
Windows 8.1 Store does support it.
This makes creating Universal Apps difficult that need this service.
The only workaround I know is using a old Silverlight app for WP.
There WCF is supported.
But then supporting both versions of the App is much more work.

Many developer will be bringing java / python / etc applications to the Windows Store via the Desktop Bridge.
It would be great if the &lt;Application Executable="launcher.exe"&gt; element or the &lt;uap3:Extension Category="windows.appExecutionAlias"&gt; element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest.xml file.
That would allow me to use the bundled javaw.exe or python.exe directly and instead of having to use my own launcher that effectively does nothing but call javaw.exe / python.exe with some predefined arguments.

It's telling me Loren ipsum

There is no XAML support for 3D in windows Metro app.
That would be very good if the XAML supporting Viewport3D or 3D elements for Metro app.

Current certification process is too heavy and still not automated.
It could take up to 5 days to submit and publish update, because If you submit small bugfix in Friday, your submission will be delayed until Monday and then it could take up to 3 days.
I think, there is no need in manual certification more often than once a month or one time per minor version.

For example:
@@ -52,17 +52,6 @@
// Unchanged code
- // Deleted line
+ // Added line
This would be useful for GitHub related scenarios.

The UWP application platform has a rich media API which allows querying of a video device (e.g.
the Kinect) and seeing if it supports things like ExposureControl.
It seems such a shame that the new Kinect drivers expose the Kinect via this API, and yet the ExposureControl is marked as being not supported for the Kinect.
From the libfreenect2 library it seems entirely possible to tell the Kinect not to do auto-exposure.
The auto-exposure function causes major headaches for the app I'm working on, and I would dearly love to be able to turn it off.

The emulator should include a treeview control to display a live view of:
  Page States
  App State
  IsolatedStorageSettings
  IsolatedStorageFile(s)
The ideal would include some kind of object drill down in the style of Mole for WPF, but even ToStrings would work.
This combined with file drag drop from Windows Explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler.

At the moment the app license check requires an internet connection or caching of license information.
For consecutive checks (after the first app start) it should be possible to check the license offline without having to implement custom (possible unsecure) license caching.


Ixe2x80x99m missing an API for UWP applications to check if tile template is supported for the device that the application is running.
For instance, when writing this xe2x80x9cTileLargexe2x80x9d is supported on desktop but not on the phone.

If you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings.
This would be much easier if you could just recive the scrolledtoend event

After a trial has expired the expiration date is set to:
Month 12, Day 31, year 9999

Provide a pre-certification tool that runs all the tests the Marketplace certification tool runs.
So developpers can have more confidence it will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting to the marketplace.
Time saver for Developers and Microsoft.

So, acutally how the get / respect the Users Regional Format settings?
I started the windows phone 8.1 emulator with the following configuration for testing purpose:
UI Language: German,
Region: US,
Format Settings: Irish.
I have found no way to get the Information, that the user has set his format settings to irish.
And my only wish is to format a DateTime like the user wants to see it.
Regional Format does not automaticly mean the region i set the device to or the UI Langauge i chose.
On my Devices i set the UI to english but want to see all TimeStamps and Dates in the German format...
But at the Moment there is no way to get the setting the user made in the Phone settings.

Summary: MoveFileEx() doesn't always delete files.
Platform: Windows.10 (bug doesn't happen on Windows 8.1 and earlier)
How to reproduce:
1.
Create a file.
Set permission DACL - one access allowed ACE for local administrator, no ACL inheritance.
2. call MoveFileEx(MoveFileEx(FileName,0,MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT);
3. reboot
4. observe that file is still there
5. observer the delete entry is still there: SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSession Manager
6.
Change file permissions to allow all access to everyone
7.
Reboot
8.
Observe the file deleted
PS.
Is it the right place to report bugs to Microsoft?
Why do we need to call bug reports "New Ideas"?
PPS.
It would be nice to know what permissions are required on the file to be deleted (without giving all access to everyone).
Create a file
Is this the right way to report a bug to Microsoft

As with CSS, it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, etc with a TextTransform property in Xaml.
This would eliminate the need to create a string converter, and allow the transformation of text which is not added through data binding.
An example of it in use would be:
&lt;TextBlock Foreground="White" Text="My Application" TextTransform="Upper" /&gt;
&lt;Button Content="cancel" TextTransform="Sentence" /&gt;
&lt;TextBox TextTransform="Lower" Text="{TemplateBinding Text}" /&gt;

Image control with zoom in and out by double tap or Slider's value in desktop and pinch zoom in touch enabled screen.

Please include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too.
We have too many developers here in Yemen who would develop to windows phone and store apps.

allow all those folders which are accessible by a filepicker to be accesed directly by code or by using path to a specific file in computer's hard drive.
or you can say that once a user had selected some files with filepicker these files should be able to be used in future run of app without need of filepicker, and 1000 should not be a limit, user can just allow the app to access specific folders of the computer, so we will not need a "futureaccesslist" api .

My app contains a CalendarView component.
The user opens the app, looks at the CalendarView with today highlighted and lets the app run into the next day.
The user looks at the CalendarView, the today highlight doesn't update and therefore shows yesterday's date as today

Currently when using WriteableBitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the UI thread.
This is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing you're slowing the UI and negatively affecting the user experience.
It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non-ui threads (and then loaded by ui-thread image objects)

If my app gets rejected I want information about this on the Dashboard.
Not just send a mail somewhere.
The dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard.
That's why it exists

Since I upgraded to the most current version of VS/UWP, the following code no longer works in Designer:
&lt;Page.Resources&gt;
   &lt;viewmodel:view x:Key="VIEW"/&gt;
&lt;/Page.Resources&gt;
&lt;Page.DataContext&gt;
   &lt;Binding Source="{StaticResource VIEW}"/&gt;
&lt;/Page.DataContext&gt;
This was a very elegant and convenient way to tie a page to a viewmodel class.
Now, as a workaround, I have to declare the DataContext of the first control to the static resource... that is error prone, to say the least.
Why, just why, did you have to change that???
I now how to manually fix a lot of pages to make them usable in Designer again...


I've written a helper for binding to and from Observables, similar to frameworks like angular2.
I think it would be useful to have in the toolkit.
its currently available at https://github.com/aL3891/ObservableDatabinding

When developing with the phone connected via USB, having the screen lock itself is very annoying, and makes app deployment fail.
Some WP7 phone (not the AT&amp;T Samsung Focus) have a "never" screen timeout.
However this is for battery and powered scenarios, and you don't want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time.
Some of us are stuck with a phone that locks itself all the time.
The screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment.
This makes Visual Studio fail to start the debugging session.
An app deployment should unlock the screen and reset the lock timer to zero.

MinYear was an interesting feature choice.
But, if you consider real world use case like credit card information, MinDate would actually be a lot more helpful.

Chinese and Italian support have already been asked for.

It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.
It is quite hard to find a solution to something you never heard about before but with the right pointers/keywords it could be done efficiently and nearly effortlessly.
As example for an obvious issue and easy solution, if you know something about the problem:
My app failed certification because of dark/light theme problems.
I.e.
I set the background to a fixed color (black) in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by Windows Phone automatically, hence no text is readable.
This problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case.
Adding the following four lines to a report, that probably has been sent out thousands of times, would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading:
----------------------
This might help with Dark/Light theme problems:
- (Visibility)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneDarkThemeVisibility"]; or similar
- (Brush)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneBackgroundBrush"];
----------------------
and maybe additional links to documentation

In VS2015 (and maybe in 2017) the compiler raised a warning (that we missed) that stated some of our code was "currently unsupported" by the UWP toolchain.
This led to a runtime crash that took a long time to figure out.
To me, something that may cause a runtime crash (and that the compiler clearly "knows" to flag) should not a warning but an error.
The specific issue was:
warning : SG0002 : Cannot generate serialization code for type '***'
The 'MethodName' property of the KnownTypeAttribute on type 'ObjectModel.Entities.BaseThing' is not currently supported.
See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=723954 for more information.

Right now we can't able to assign ItemsSource to MapIcon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple Map Icons loads from database.

As of now, it's only possible to set the CalenderIdentifier property to tell the control which calender to use.
It's not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan/Shaban though which can vary per region/user (some users like to use the adjustment of a different country).
The Windows 10 Calender app show cases this feature, with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri, a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice.
I don't know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it right now.
Not for any of the datetime controls anyway (DatePicker, CalenderView etc.
).

I'd like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using PeerfFinder, but while the app is not in the foreground.
If I understand correctly, this is not currently possible.
Would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it?

When a corporate customer tries to submit app, an error message "Your account doesn't have permission to submit apps to the Store" displays and they cannot submit any app.
I know that this message means when Symantec vetting is triggered, but this message is vague and doesn't mention what user needs to do.
Please modify like this.
"Your account is validating by Symantec.
You cannot submit any app during this period.
It will takes 7 to 10 days typically.
Open your account settings and make sure registered information is correct.
When you modify account information, vetting will be triggered automatically.

Provide a way for apps to request other apps to fill input fields.
A good example of this is an app with a login screen.
The user could fill the username and password manually or call another app that can provide those fields.
It's something like Android[1] and iOS Autofill Framework.

In UWP applications with the codeGeneration manifest capability, allow the use of the existing exception table APIs currently marked desktop-only.
On UWP for x86-64, ARM and ARM64, it's not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime, because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically-generated code.
These are the APIs that ought to be allowed in UWP when codeGeneration is permitted:
RtlAddFunctionTable
RtlAddGrowableFunctionTable
RtlDeleteFunctionTable
RtlDeleteGrowableFunctionTable
Complicated:
RtlInstallFunctionTableCallback - the OutOfProcessCallbackDll parameter is problematic, and probably shouldn't be allowed in UWP.
Otherwise, this function is useful to runtime code generation.
(Add|Remove)Vectored(Exception|Continue)Handler - these are also useful for runtime code generation, but can be problematic for long-term support.
These APIs ought to be allowed for any UWP application, but are most useful when working with runtime code generation:
RtlCaptureContext
RtlRestoreContext

This is only relevant for desktop UWP apps.
There are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed.
One such case is here:
https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/18075751-remove-in-process-appservice-lifetime-restrictions
You can at least provide any of these solutions.
1.
Add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray.
https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/12817866-uwp-system-tray-support
2.
You can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically.
You need to provide CoreWindow.Minimise() api in this case.

The WPF Grid control had a ShowGridLines property.
This is helpful for layout debugging.
This property is missing in UWP.

Please add the From To options right after "Download new email" under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.
Due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night.
It's extremely annoying.
Even my old phone Nokia E71 running on Symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked.
Thanks!

ensure that we can buy clips, movies and videos directly to WP7 without necessarily going through a PC

A DatePickerFlyout whose Date is two-way bound will update target-to-source but not source-to-target.
The following link appears to refer to the same bug.
After seven months, the issue still has not been addressed.

As of now UIElement.Clip accepts only RectangleGeometry in UWP applications.
Please make changes so that it can accept any Geometry like it is in WPF.

The biggest problem I almost exclusively run into when working on WP7 apps is the layout performance of Silverlight.
It's takes quite some effort to work around that problem.
And according to web searches about this problem I felt that I'm not a lone with this.
It'd be great if you would work on a solution to improve the situation.

Make ProgressRing control available for Windows Phone just like Win8.

Add the ability to send the application for inclusion in the collection of applications store.
For example: I want to include my WinGeoChat application in the collection "Apps for Work".

A/B testing is crucial for quantitative marketing.
Let us build test variations on our app descriptions, screenshots, etc... and get reports on which variation performs better in terms of conversion rate (downloads/page views).

Please add CoerceValueCallback and ValidateValueCallback delegates which can be used while defining DependencyProperties.
(just like in WPF)

The CreateStreamedFileAsync() method is there since Windows 8 to delay creation of file data.
However, when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation, Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 "No such interface supportedxe2x80x9d.
It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer, which really is a shame.
There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files, that are used heavily e.g.
in WinZIP and similar applications, to delay actual unzip of files until really required, but they cannot be used in UWP.
Please support the UWP equivalent called CreateStreamedFileAsync  in Windows Explorer!

Collapsing back button leads to very ugly look when the view is extended to title bar.
Even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button.
In minimal mode,
the hamburger button is on the side of the back button.
Nav View should be made a full proof solution for developers.
Nav View should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent.

Currently, UWP app has to be installed in device memory in order to use custom audio file in toast notification.
In case app is installed in SD card and notification uses custom audio file, default notification sound is played instead of custom audio file.

Currently the RelativeSourceMode only supports None, TemplatedParent and Self.
Would be really helpful to have FindAncestor API added, just like in Silverlight 5 and WPF.

We'll, currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.
I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this, and I have found some.
But they all differ in what to do exactly.
What would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token.

Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.
This enumeration is mainly used with AppBarButton like as "&lt;AppBarButton Icon="Smile"/&gt;".
Recent Segoe MDL2 asset have many of new glyphs.
But the enumeration of Symbol is not updated from Win10 10240.
And, some of important glyphs of 10240 are also lacked from the enumeration.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.symbol
For example, "Share" glyph - 0xE72D - is not enumerated.
This cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs.
In fact, we can use 0xE7D Share with FontIcon element without the enumeration.
But, many of developers don't.
(Like "Photo" app)
If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL2 glyphs, it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs.

There seems to be a bug in the DatePicker control that appears when the system TimeZone changes.
This can be easily reproduced, start by creating a UWP app that has the DatePicker control, and a TextBlock below it, bind them both to a DateTimeOffset object that will contain the value of DateTime.Now.
Reproduction steps:
1) Start the app, controls show DateTime.Now
2) Use TZUTIL in CMD to change Timezone to something that makes the date change (For instance, from UTC-12 to UTC+14)
3) Update controls with DateTime.Now
Expected: DatePicker shows DateTime.Now.
Actual: DatePicker shows old day, when opened shows correct day.
The only workaround I've found so far is to reinitialize the page, by calling the Application.LoadComponent which can be copied from the pages InitializeComponent method (open with object explorer).
Here's a test app that can be used:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g75jIHKzsBqDzUy7MPZxgEnVcJlrQlpQ?usp=sharing
Just make sure to change timezone so that the day changes, and do it while the app is running, and observe the bug.

Currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that.
This publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps LocalStorage folder.
If you are careless during signup you are stuck and can't change the publisher id, and therefore that naming of your packages.

Currently there's a set of COM APIs, that provide access to Virtual Desktop-related features, like pinning apps to desktops, switching desktops, etc.
Unfortunately, most of it is undocumented, and does not seem to be stabilized (2018 Spring Update for instance changed IApplicationView's CLSID, so apps using it stopped working).

Now that native development is an option, it's very frustrating that one can't debug the native code that's being executed on the device without a real device.
Back in the Windows Mobile/CE days, Microsoft had a Device Emulator that would faithfully emulate an ARM CPU and would execute exactly that same code that eventually went to the device.
This capability was essential for certain low-level tasks like native crash investigation, debugging stack clobbering scenarios, deep optimization with inline assembly (e. g. for NEON) and such.
Now that capability is lost.
Please bring it back.

Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as "childrens stories" so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps.
Secondly, you need to limit the number of apps that a publisher can submit with a particular key word.
For instance, if I build a children's book app and then submit that same app 50 times, each time with a different name and book loaded, i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen, thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design.
All subsequent children's book apps will be essentially "undiscoverable" no matter how good they are...

Are you asking for the UWP MapControl to run in WPF while in Windows 10?

The new TreeView control has a poor selection experience for unexpandable nodes.
The user cannot click in the area to the left of the item's content in order to select the item - there is a "gap" that is filled by the expand/contract chevron, which is present for an unexpandable item but has its Opacity set to 0 (hence: not clickable).
The user tries to select the item but cannot.
This is a very poor user experience as the rest of the item can be clicked to select it.
The user has no idea why sometimes clicking to select works, and sometimes doesn't.

Please make kids corner as a another account.
This will make wp users very   happy .
Moreover kidscorner are not used by most of the bachelors.
Atleast          remove password for kidscorner or make another password for kidscorner.

It appears that the MapIcon rendering by the MapControl has changed significantly with the Windows 10 Creators update.
We have an app that at times, adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl.
Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority, if not all, were displayed.
After creators update, we are only seeing a small portion of the MapIcon objects being rendered onto the map.
And it's not because they are colliding with other MapIcons.
We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons we've added.
We have always been aware of the guidance that a MapIcon is not guaranteed to be displayed, but it's never been a problem.
We've even tried setting MapElementCollisionBehavior.RemainVisible but it doesn't make much difference.
It seems like there's now some sort of internal limit on how many MapIcons are displayed at a time.
I couldn't find anything in the release notes about this change.
Is this change in behavior expected or a bug?

It does not look professional when scrolling upward at the end of any page or downward at the top the content of the page regardless of material or application will be stretched down

Wexc2xa0DESPERATELY want to convert to a full uwp app.
We currently havexc2xa0a store app that works with our desktop app and it causes a great deal of confusion.
It alsoxc2xa0creates a large hurdle for new users andxc2xa0causes a number of headaches.
The issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures.
We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to addxc2xa0touchxc2xa0keyboard hotkeys to a dockedxc2xa0custom keyboard (typically aids in drawing andxc2xa0ink based applications)
our question is, would converting our app to use newer windows inkxc2xa0code (forgive my lack of knowledge here) and if possiblexc2xa0switching to the code that powers the new on screen trackpad if that would allow us to convert to uwp via the desktop app converter.
is there a plan to include app conversion forxc2xa0desktop programs that use ui access?
I love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation I have to get in touch with you guys andxc2xa0find the answers to these questions.xc2xa0
if you need anything from me forxc2xa0any reason I will do what ever I need to do to improve our software for our users.
It would mean the world to me!

Allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the Store

Our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that we'd like to sync for them with Windows 10 contacts.
We are working on the Converted version of the app, to enable such capabilities, and to distribute our desktop app via the Windows Store, but we have to distribute it for previous versions of Windows as well, and so we can't afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being.
It'd be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps.

I have a Style targeting a FontIcon control with a Setter for the FontFamily.

The method would be useful for developers who must deal with diacritics in multilanguage apps.

Currently if you purchase apps for your business and assign them to users, you can't publish them to the private store, otherwise users who have not been assigned a license will get an error when installing the app.
It would make sense that the app be published to the private store, and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message.
Otherwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps.

If would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application, it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a Popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario (like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered).

Provide an option to keep a "Keep-alive" connection in background so that we can create IM

WinRT doesn't have an easy way to scale the content on Image Controls with the nearest neighbor algorithm.
When I have an image that will be zoomed in on, I don't want it to get anti-aliased, which is the forced current behavior in WinRT.
If there was a feature like WPF's RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode that supported specification of a nearest neighbor algorithm, it would fix the problem.
While this is possible with CompositionSurface, i feel it is needed on the Image Control as well.

I love the universal app approach.
But my WP app need an alarm.
I found in msdn that the alarm manager class is not supported.
So I have to stick to sliverlight8.1.
When will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone?

The old format of showing up to 8 screen shots side by side would give a user a better feel for the app as a whole.
The new single view at a time may let you display a landscape image on the pc store but on the phone it comes up squished in the center of a portrait format picture - so that doesn't buy you anything.
If the app is a windows phone only app - cater to it.. instead of this one size shoe fits all.
Not sure what the labels under the images do - they don't show up on the web page.

Often, the same command is available in an app through different ways.
It might be placed in a MenuFlyout, in a Button, in a AppBarButton.
I would like to use the same resource for it, otherwise I would have duplicate localization entries, creating work and confusion for translators.
The problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content:
Button --&gt; Content
MenuFlyoutItem --&gt; Text
AppBarButton --&gt; Label
So for my x:Uid="MyAction" I would need the following resources:
MyAction.Content
MyAction.Text
MyAction.Label
All with the same original and translated text for all languages!
It is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources, just becase the same command has now moved to a different control.
Now my idea: All controls could have a default property for localization.
So if I set x:Uid="MyAction" and only a resource "MyAction" exists (with no ".&lt;Property&gt;" ending), the Button would use it as Content, the MenuFlyoutItem as Text, the AppBarButton as Label, a TextBlock would use it as Text, some other controls might use it as Header.
An attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a Xaml Control.
This would save us a lot of effort, it would make resource names shorter and easier to read, and it would allow us to re-use the same localization in different places and different (adaptive) UI views.

API to emulate Radio Access Cards using NFC.
That way WP can be used as a universal access card.
A lot of corporate users who have to carry their access card with them will appreciate it.
It will eliminate the situation when a person forgets his access card and has to go to the security office to get a temporary one.
One possible application of such API is ability to configure the access card ID from Active Directory.
That way IT administrators will be able to provision new access codes using familiar infrastructure.
It will also make a corporation more independent in choice of a hardware provider for their access cards.
It will even allow seamless migration to new hardware.
WP will be able to work with multiple access card formats simultaneously.

Make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once.
For example, three quick touch strokes to scroll immediately to the top or bottom.
Really long lists and views are boring to scroll even at maximum scroll speed.
Keyboard have Home/End keys to scroll to top/bottom, but touch screen doesn't have same capability.

Some excellent tools to help find good cellular service, like GSM Monitor, are not currently supported due to lack of an api to support the raw cellular data in real time.

It would be nice to have a way to automate update/upgrade Bash Ubuntu on Windows 10 that does not require to start Bash.

It seems that since around 15043, when showing LoggingChannel.LogMessage() calls, the string message portion is blank in device portal (shows stringmessage:,).
Same code on machine with anniversary update, portal shows the string message in payload.
capturing events with xperf shows the message in EventData as expected, so I know it's logging correctly.
Something seems to have changed with loggingchannel, possibly default manifest code that handles the string message has changed around 15043?
FWIW, preview versions of windows post anniversary update were showing the message correctly.

I cannot port my Windows Phone Silverlight App to UWP, because it is depending on the Panorama Control, which is missing in UWP.
The panorama control is still the best control for my app and my users love it.
Updating the app to UWP is not possible without this control.
The Hub control is not a suitable replacement.

Especially for StringFormatConverter and FormatStingConverter.
Should also do this for other converters for same behavior.

If first cues start/end time is in "mm:ss" format, and continues with format "h:mm:ss" - they will not be parsed and not showed in TimedMetadataTrack.Cues list.

It works.
59:57.280 --&gt; 1:00:00.990
But it is not parsed
1:00:01.740 --&gt; 1:00:04.080
Also not parsed

Would be great to have the ability to blink the taskbar icon for the application.
This feature is really usefull in messaging apps.

Would be nice to have a callback on for example the phonecalltask so that we can determine wether or not the user actually did press "call" or "cancel".
Same for other tasks and launchers.

Allow developers to implement an interface(s) on a user control and "submit" that instead of just filling in a tile data structure.
This will make tiles truly "live" and open up the live of WP7 to new applications.
This is also completely secure because the runtime can analyze the class (and it's IL) being submitted.
A bevy of restrictions can also be heaped on the said user control in order to maintain performance and not sap battery life.
Let Live tiles be live, please.

Earlier there was option to cumulative download of all the app and now there is now way I can see total number of app downloads till date.

There is no possibility to choose a specific port number.
sending an UDP Broadcast (send to 255.255.255.255) is not supported.
In this case an exception is thrown.
We need UPD broadcast to search for our devices in the network.
These devices have a simple network interface an cannot be extended for several reasons (flash size, communication library).
UPNP and UDP Multicast is not supported by these devices.
The only possibility to search them is to use UDP Broadcast.
We get an answer back and know how devices are in the network.
Then we can use the Smartphone as remote control four our devices.

The Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity ETW provider has some updated events with new fields on WIndows 10 1803 (specifically event 11, but there may be other ones), but the version field in these events has not been updated.
This makes working with these events a bit difficult, as you need to keep track of Windows versions for compatibility, instead of simply checking the version field of the event itself.

Closing the StreamSocket (by disposing/deleting it) should stop all the pending asynchronous operations, reads or writes.
It used to do this in Windows 8 and early Windows 10 versions but this apparently changed a while ago.

Right now it is very difficult (and completely undocumented) to determine if a photo or picture is marked as a favorite by a user, or to retrieve a list of favorites (similar to getting the list of pictures in the KnownFolders.CameraRoll, etc).
If a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites, we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications.

Give us a Print() function for the UWP WebView control.
Using WebViewBrush isn't an acceptable response.

Create a Cordova plugin to enable IOS and Android hybrid apps to use Project Rome features.

I know that there is RoamingData and there even is this "HighPriority" entry that you can use for "quickly" roaming app data.
However, even the HighPriority data typically takes at least one minute to roam to other devices.
This is way too slow, data needs to arrive within few seconds.
With Apple fronting Continuity, we need a simple way to do the same on the Windows platform to be able to compete!
I know that it is possible to use raw push notification and an azure server with PNS to achieve the same.
But setting this up is a lot of work, handling authentication, targeting the notifications to just the specific users,... After hours of searching I have not found an example that handles this complete scenario in Azure.
Also, the user either has to login or give his consent when using his windows login.
This could be so much easier if you either make the HighPriority roaming faster or add a different way to quickly roam data to the other devices of the user, directly accessible from the Windows API.
A lot more apps would make use of this if it was just easier, and soon Windows Apps would catch up with latest Apple Apps with regards to Continuity (which is a gret concept!
).
I understand that you would need to restrict the amount of traffic on this, which is ok.
It would be sufficient to only send updates on certain points, e.g.
app getting suspended, video or music getting paused,...
So the amount of data and amount of requests per time could be limited, with updates getting delayed if the app sends too many updates in a short time.
But for apps that make resonable use of this, near-instant data roaming should be possible!

ContainerEncodingProperties seems to support "MPEG2TS" video container:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.mediaproperties.containerencodingproperties.subtype#Windows_Media_MediaProperties_ContainerEncodingProperties_Subtype
Windows 10 and UWP Apps seems to support H.264 encoding with "MPEG2TS" container:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/supported-codecs
Why I can't set the Subtype property to "MPEG2TS" in the ContainerEncodingProperties object?
Target is to live stream the webcam (video and audio) from Raspberry Pi in Windows IoT Core UWP app to a browser use MPEG2TS encoding (MPEG-DASH).

//Throws System.ArgumentException: 'Value does not fall within the expected range.'

-Should be able to manage Data On/Off directly from the Notification center.


In the dashboard, when you are uploading images in the app description, it does not work for me as I'm 100% sure there's a timeout implemented in the uploading code.
I can upload the smaller promotional images fine, but the larger sceenshot pngs will not upload.
Yes my internet upload speed is slow, but the site should function for slow upload speeds also, why not.
The same goes for the app uploading itself, a larger timeout is there, but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed, which not everyone has.
Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly, but not worldwide, and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.
Just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least 5 - its not a big deal to implement.

Can't the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than "SystemPolicy" ("ApplicationClosing", "ApplicationSuspended",...)?
It would allow us to notify the user when an ExtendedExecutionSession is closed by the system.
Actually we can't because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application.

This is very frustrating, but in beta builds where we're including symbols in our appxupload, the store gets confused and can't read the correct version number out of our manifest.
Instead it uses a munged version of the current date and time.

It is absolutely necessary to be able to distinguish between the case where the user is closing and an and when they are minimizing it, especially on the desktop (the expectations of a user are different on a mobile phone).
I would suggest an extra parameter in the suspending argument which would be an enum giving the reason for suspending being called.
Alternatively you could add an extra event if that fits better.
Why?
Well, consider this example.
A developer creates an app that allows the user to perform some bulk file operation such as permanently deleting a large number of files.
Scenario 1: suppose the user starts the operation, then realises they didn't mean to.
Their immediate reaction is to close the app using the close button as quickly as possible.
Scenario 2: suppose the user did indeed mean to start the operation, but realises it's going to take a long time so they minimize the app in order to do something else while to operation completes.
In the first scenario, it is critical that the app cancels the operation as quickly as possible.
In the second scenario it is important for the app to keep the operation going as long as possible until it completes.
These are completely conflicting situations, but the app currently has no way to tell the difference between the two!

There's one area where Mango is a retrograde step when compared with NoDo : theme support.
In NoDo the user could leave the app switch the theme (i.e.
Dark or Light) &amp; return to the app which would now, in theory, respect their selection.
In Mango the user's faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system's theme state at start-up.
Developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme &amp; sticking to it, thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless.

remove useless app or the app uses fake icon (e.g.
all app made by Edutainment 4u)Those are rubbish!!

The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago, but you won't know until you try to send something which isn't desirable).
Many of the old implementations in .Net and even in VB6 socket control had this functionality (and it was highly useful).
The proposal is to add something like:
if (socket.status != ConnectionStatus.Connected)
    // Something happened, update your UI or run your business logic

Many developers open a company account with personal Microsoft account incorrectly.
Registration process doesn't display subscription will be associated to Microsoft account that currently signing in.
MSDN document explain this a little bit, but it is hard to realize from the document.
(And most of user doesn't read before signup.)
Obviously lack of explanation.
So when a developer attempt to open as company(business) during registration process, please display an alert like this:
You are signing in with Microsoft account "abc@live.com".
Your subscription "Windows Store Developer" will be associated to "abc@live.com"
Once you associated, you cannot change this.
If you are opening as company/business account, you need to share your credential when your colleague needs to access developer dashboard.
Our developer dashboard doesn't have an ability to add other user as secondary user.
When you registered with wrong account, you need to contact Microsoft support and cancel it and needs to signup with correct Microsoft account again.
(You will also have another vetting process by Symantec that will take 7 to 10 days.)
Do you really want to proceed?

In UWP in Windows.Web.Http.HttpCookieManager you can only get Cookies via this API
public HttpCookieCollection GetCookies(Uri uri);
Unfortunately I am not going to know all uri's the cookies are in without tracking every single domain visited (which is what I currently have to do).
I do this so I can clear all Cookies.
An API that would take 5 minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding is
public HttpCookieCollection GetAllCookies();
Or secondary to that a DeleteAllCookies() or ClearCookies() API as that is the only reason I need to get all of them and I can't think of any other use cases to retrieve all cookies.
Happy to go either way.

Use app version in Windows Store instead of date/time autogenerated version when using appxbundle.

Provide computer vision APIs that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking, facial/gesture/voice recognition, egomotion, structures from motion and object identification etc.

We have an add-in to Microsoft Office and we can see the OS version of our customers that are installing but we cannot see the version of Office, ie.
2010, 2013, 2016, etc.
It would be helpful to see the Office version as well.

We need backward compatibility for XAML just like Android, for example, we can just use NavigationView without any conditional check at all.
Conditional check doesn't actually solve the problem, it doesn't suit the control like NavigationView, since at the end developer still have to create a "NavigationView" with SplitView, which is really pain to maintain.

Microsoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets.
Don't know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works.
Anyway.
Is this possible to use this feature in our Windows App Store Universal Apps and if we can , do we have any sample code to accomplish this ?
Don't want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that.
The panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the API from inside our Apps it would be great.
Can this be achieved ?

Plesae implement Windows.ApplicationModel.SuspendingDeferral as IDisposable (probably already declared in ISuspendingDeferral) and call method Complete() from within IDisposable.Dispose() to simplify its usage:

                //do something
            }
            SuspendingDeferral d = e.SuspendingOperation.GetDeferral();
            //do something
            d.Complete();

Add the Assembly.Load method which accepts byte[] as a parameter in order to load an assembly in to the app domain.
All the other platforms support this: .Net, Silverlight, Android (Xamarin), and even iOS (Xamarin)!
Why is the UWP team stubbornly resisting this?
Without this UWP is more or less a toy because any customization requires that the app be deployed completely separately.
Other platforms allow for customization to be downloaded and dynamically loaded in to the app domain.

Enable AppX repairs - a la App-v.
We've got the clean un/install but no app-level resets?
I'd also LOVE to see better extension/entrypoint/OS integration, similar to App-v.
Do people *really* launch their app and THEN 'get' their file they wanted (my strong experience is people find their file and then let the file type associations work for them.
That's nice if an app holds it's own content-type, but experimenting with AppX's of things like Notepad2, 7-zip, and media players REALLY doesn't help when the OS reserves these FTAs for itself!
The FTA's are meant to be user-changeable

Basically WebBrowser control is useless in its current form.
For example, if I want to enrich experience for one particular web site which is not mobile-friendly, I have to implement complete HTML parser and then show markup via XAML controls.

There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.
We also have no entries listed for Windows 10 emulators (running or not) in the 'devices' output.
The biggest issue/ask is to deploy an app to an emulator via that command line tool, in much the same way the AppDeployCmd worked for 8.1.
Without that, we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.
The older tooling (AppDeployCmd.exe) would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them (though it's support for devices left a lot to be desired).
Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK, we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).
So currently, we can use the 8.1 tooling to get the list of emulators, but if we try to deploy to them they'll start up but app deployment will fail.
In doing some testing, it appears WinAppDeployCmd _may_ work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the 169.254.x.x IP address of the emulator - but I can find no way to get that programmatically either.

I'm using the Roaming Settings and Data to allow a user to have the same data across all of their devices.
It would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device.
This way I could update tiles, change reminders or notifications across all devices.
Even if it was linked to a specific settings name like "HighPriority" or a custom name would give even more specific tasks when certain things change.
Microsoft seems to be giving us a lot more flexibility to get the work done behind the scenes without the user knowing that they are going on.
This would be just another way that the developers can update things and keep all devices synchronised.

Was scratching my head wondering what was going on until I enabled verbose msbuild output.
Seems if a specified LayoutFile (in AppXPackageFileList) is missing, a file copy is skipped and no other output occurs.
It seems this should, at the very least, raise a warning.

Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.
Even to suggest a path is not possible.
So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string.
So at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:very long path..final_folder.
and thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder.
so this is now in 2017 after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative: change to UWP ?
actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid)
            FolderPicker picker = new FolderPicker ();
            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add("*");
            picker.ViewMode = PickerViewMode.Thumbnail;
            picker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
            picker.CommitButtonText = "Select a Folder";
            StorageFolder picked_Folder = await picker.PickSingleFolderAsync();
so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path, but only a selection of libraries.
does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup?
now after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP.
suggestion or question:
does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?

The Windows.Services.Store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing.
If you use the Windows.Services.Store namespace to implement in-app purchases or trials, you must publish your app to the Store and download the app to your development device to use its license for testing.
Provide funtionality similar to CurrentAppSimulator class found in Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace.

If I have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user's contacts, I should have a way to click on that user and show the user's details in the native experience.
I am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact's details and re-create them in your own UI... which would be great if the API exposed all of the user's details (like the Anniversary) which it does not.
Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles).

I have an app that works normally, but when launched via the Desktop Bridge there's some strange issues with COM.
What does the Desktop Bridge do differently?

Well I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does)  Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps.
And if possible add the ability to connect to the pubcenter as well, or make a 2nd app to handle that.
Although I do like the idea of being able to see both the download, and advertising stats for an app at once/one screen or easily go between the two.

Return back a multi-task support (may be optional?)
will significal improve advanced users experience.
In current situation its almost impossible to create some kind of applications, such as different trackers, survilence etc

to clarify certification failures and speed up publishing process.
Often, certification report contains little information about the failure.
There are times when errors cannot be duplicate even after following the steps from the tester.

`fetch()` call on UWP app always throws "SEC7120: Origin null not found in Access-Control-Allow-Origin header."
This must be solved for UWP apps to use Fetch API.

When running through C++ Code Analysis, projects using ATL will minimally hit the following atlcom.h warnings:

WarningtC6386

Maybe there is a way to create an API to allow us to make the live tiles really interactive (with buttons and other controls)

If the app shows sensitive data when deativated, it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application

Future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead.
It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.
Not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than 1000 file access - why to give such a handicap for the whole platform?
How UWP apps can compete with other systems with such things?
It can even be a capabailty for declared files types, so when user installs the app, he allows it to have such access.
BTW - seems that FutureAccessList sometimes has bugs and people are leaving platform and apps: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/18713362-futureaccesslist-bug-after-os-update

It appears there is a "Enter File Name" even when selecting an existing file using FileSavePicker on UWP mobile.
It seems to work as expected on desktop.
You can see my original question on MSDN forum below.
https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/52bc9358-eae8-4f2a-9269-96858ab23cde/uwpselecting-a-file-to-overwrite-text-in-uwp-app?forum=wpdevelop

Why do you always have to make a developer's life difficult.
There's no easy way to detect Left Control key pushes.
Because on international keyboards, if Right Alt is pressed, then Left Control is also pressed?
Why oh why, this is the stupidest thing ever.
I thought when designing a new API you could get rid of all the ******** and just make things clean and simple.
So I've developed a work around, to detect key pushes for LeftCtrl and RightAlt, and if both are pressed at the same time, then LeftCtrl pushes are ignored.
   void OnKeyDown(CoreWindow^ sender, KeyEventArgs^ args) // mouse buttons are not passed here
      KB_KEY key=KB_KEY(args-&gt;VirtualKey);
      switch(key)
      {
         case KB_CTRL: if(!args-&gt;KeyStatus.IsExtendedKey){Kb._special++; return;} break; // because this can be triggered by pressing RightAlt too, we need to record this event, and if RightAlt is pressed in the same frame, than cancel this, there's no other way, because holding RightAlt results in 'GetKeyState' being on for left ctrl too
         case KB_ALT : if( args-&gt;KeyStatus.IsExtendedKey) Kb._special--;          break;
And later I check if(Kb._special&gt;0)
But that doesn't work too, because now it turns out, that if I press just RightAlt, then I can get callbacks for LeftCtrl and RightAlt happening in different frames.
OnKeyDown with LeftCtrl gets called in frame 10
OnKeyDown with RightAlt gets called in frame 11
Why can't you just make it easy and get rid of AltGr altogether.
Waiting for reply.

UWP should include a Augmented reality SDK simlar to Apple ARKit and Google AR Dev Kit

Provide a single link to retrieve all the applications by a specific Publisher like the Android Market.
This just helps make advertising easier, without listing individual apps.

Allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device.
This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project  the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receivers

There should be a PowerShell prompt in Device Portal that lets me run extra commands.

It would be great if windows phone will support access to contactxc2xb4s groups.
It will be great for 3rd party apps to sort/group contacts by contactxc2xb4s groups.


Right now, we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done, by using 'RequestMessage.TransportInformation'.
Because of this, it is not possible to have a decent implementation of SSL pinning using the HttpClient (or any other method without rebuilding the entire networking stack), The request should not actually take place if the certificate validation fails.
It is possible to install allowed certificates through the Package.appxmanifest file and then checking Exclusive trust.
But unfortunately, this is application wide, and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33715933/drag-and-drop-a-file-on-windows-universal-app
Please add simple API:
void OnFilesDropped(String file_names[], int window_client_pos_x, int window_client_pos_y) {..}
I don't want to use a File Picker, or XAML.
What I want is to drag and drop a file, then be able to get its full path and file name as stored on the disk, and access it using standard C++ IO file access functions, such as fopen, fread, etc.
I don't want to use XAML, because: it looks complicated, it looks like it can reduce performance, I'm making 3D heavy DirectX based applications that need full performance.
I handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using DirectX rendering.
In WinAPI I can do this so easy, just handle the "case WM_DROPFILES" callback and get the file name.
This works briliantly with just few lines of code.
Which means there's no real simple API for UWP to do this, and what I want is a simple API.
I don't want a FilePicker solution, because the more natural way (faster) is just drag and drop, if I already see the file I want to process, for example on the desktop, then I can just drag and drop, onto the app, so easy.
But if I have to use a FilePicker, then I need to: 1) click "open" to open the file picker 2) go to the path folder location of the file - very slow task 3) select the file 4) press OK.
So many things to do compared to just drag and drop.
Also I've followed your links, and it really sounds awfully complicated, honestly I don't know where to start.
Imagine I'm writing an application that can convert files.
For example, I drag and drop a BMP image, my app compresses it and saves as PNG image automatically in the same folder with the same name.
For example: I drag and drop "C:Folderimage.bmp" file onto my app window, and my app will generate "C:Folderimage.png" So what I need, is a simple API, like: void OnFilesDropped(String file_names[], int window_client_pos_x, int window_client_pos_y) {..} where 'file_names' is an array of full path names of all files/folders drag and dropped onto the app, and other 2 parameters are the XY coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured.
So in my example application I would do something like this: for each file_names { Image image; image.loadBMP(file_names[i]); image.savePNG(file_names[i]+".png"); }
Thank you

Currently Microsoft Store under Windows 10 shows three types of information:
- download speed;
- amount of data downloaded;
- progress bar simulating total amount of data to download
when the app/update is downloaded.
But there's no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded.
Please fix this annoying issue.

Allow for video camera control, start and stop recording from the touch screen instead of just the camera button.

Maybe I could add my OnDevice MarkupExtension to the toolkit.
It can be used for DeviceFamily specific property values.
It is inspired on the OnPlatform/OnIdiom markup extensions from Xamarin.Forms 3.2

                   FontSize="{wme:OnDevice Team=42, IoT=60, Default=21}"

Why we have access to Contact List but din't have access to owner phone number?
I don't understand why this info not similar?
If we have access to Contact List and that normal than access to owner phone nubber must be normal.
Of cource if user give rights to app.

It should return DOM element and coordinates, and in case of image also the raw bytes.
Currently it is impossible to implement context menus, save files, and implement other functions general web browsers have.
At least, receiving ScriptNotify events should be possible on http and without adding ApplicationContentUriRules in Manifest, so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own.

Currently, you can submit an app to all countries, or specific countries.
I would like a button I can click that will only select the countries for which Microsoft already accounts for any taxes.

Repro:
UWP single-page app with WebView as only control.
Edge 25.10586.0.0 @ Win10
When App is activated, WebView control gets focus (and receives corresponding event), but the content of the WebView (eg HTML) does NOT get a focus and document.hasFocus() remains false.
If user clicks on the HTML, document.hasFocus() becomes true and WebView receives LostFocus event(!)
Expected behaviour: WebView focus is in sync with document.hasFocus()

you can resize image before uploading easily...

Control explanation: This control should cover the entire app with a semi-transparent background except the highlighted UIElement so that the user can interact with the UIElement.
In short, we need a UWP alternative to ShowcaseView (https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView)
Use of the control: This control will help the user to take a tour of the app in an interactive way.

I have a ton of sites saved in my IE Favorites....it would be great to have a search box for the favorites rather than scrolling around.

Now that Xaml and DirectX support SVG images I'd love to provide my splash screen image as an SVG file.
It would save a tons of space to only have one small SVG for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files.
In fact, the smaller file size might also mean the app would load faster.
So often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app's compiled code.
(I'd also be OK using a Xaml Path.)

It would be really helpful if, for example, a developer makes an app that takes advantage of the schedule alarm API, and would like to enable the user to select a custom ringtone for that alarm.
This API proposal would enable the user to select from many ringtones already available on the phone, and save developers the trouble of having to implement their own custom ringtones.

Actually, exceptions thrown by UWP APIs are just painfully awful.
Please, bring back old-schoold and detailed exceptions like in the rock solid .NET for Win32.
Too many empty StackTraces, too many "An error as occurred", too many approximative and vague exceptions.
I understand that the unnecessary JavaScript made WinRT insanely complex to design... but please...
Exceptions are there for a reason... Not to just be "an error has occurred" message.
Thanks

trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll/pan in UWP (C#) like many web ui component as superscrollrama.js

Please improve the app submission process for internal/beta testing:
1.)
Test apps (although hidden in the store) undergo the same certification process.
This can result in submission rejections or certification reports with unpublishing warnings/dates.
2.)
The submission process for test apps takes too long.

1000 entries as limit for FutureAccessList is way to low.
Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley.
Optional show an user input dialog, requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide.
Best practice until now:
Store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the FutureAccessList.
One Exception where a folder can't be added:
A big downside hides in DragDrop (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/drag-and-drop)
If you add files from across the filesytem, which I do in my app... letting the user drop in images and videos from any location, you could rapidly hit the 1000 files limit.
To counter that and trying to add the folder from the file, this won't be possible because an exception would be thrown, even if you added the file itself to the FutureAccessList before that.
Example (trying to add folder from dragDrop Filetarget to FutureAccessList):
foreach (StorageFile file in myDropGrid.Files)
tstring token = StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessList.Add(file);
tstring dir = Path.GetDirectoryName(file.Path);
 ttry
        {
        tStorageFolder folder = await StorageFolder.GetFolderFromPathAsync(dir);
                StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessList.AddOrReplace(token, folder);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
tt// We're not able to add this folder
Clumsy workaround:
The only workaround is this: https://codedocu.com/Details?d=1613
Suggestion:
Increase FutureAccessList limit (like in millions)
Introduce Userchoice Dialog if AccessException is raised.
Also as a secondary request... let FolderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation also be a FolderRelativeId

A XAML designer for Visual Studio in Windows 7.
I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows 7, but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows 10 before writing apps for it.

It would be nice to be able to use Windows Hello not only for the verification of the user currently logged in but also for user selection: We would like to run a UWP kiosk app that would be used by firstline workers that are set up for Windows Hello face recognition.
However, the current APIs for Windows Hello only allow to authenticate the current user.
Actually, Windows Hello is capable to detect others users as of today, but the popup that appears when the users needs to be verified only gives other users the ability to cancel the operation.
It would be nice to have an API that allowed Windows Hello to authenticate other users than the user currently logged on to the system.

I noticedxc2xa0there is a possibility to block payments in the interface of my Windows Store developer account, but it is a "Boolean".
Would it be possible to get paid only a certain amount, leaving the remainder blocked on the MS accountxc2xa0?
This could be interesting for the developer = smooth payments,xc2xa0not to exceed a certain threshold and....less taxes!
And the interestxc2xa0for MS would bexc2xa0obvious.

In the current incarnation of Windows Phone 8.1, when background audio is playing (such as Xbox music, podcasts, whatever), and a Microsoft foreground microphone/audio app activates (such as the phone, etc.
), the background audio is automatically paused.
When the foreground mic/audio app stops its access, the background audio automatically resumes.
This capability is needed for third party apps also.
For example, to mute background audio before recording, a speech recognition app is forced to play a "blank" audio clip in the foreground, causing other apps' background audio to pause.
OK.
But subsequently the foreground app cannot resume the background audio.
This problem makes for a very clumsy user experience, decreasing the UX quality of the app significantly.
Is only Microsoft able to do this "magic"?

The site Windows Dev Center (https://developer.microsoft.com) is *very* slow when navigating with Edge.
We are talking page load times of several minutes in many cases.
I have done troubleshooting with Windows developer support who knew about the issue and recommended using another browser, like IE.
The site is faster in Chrome and IE, but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance.
As a Windows developer I would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance.
Currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected and not prioritized.

I have some more feature recommendations, regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will.
Search bar : a top search bar attached to the control which can be enabled/disabled with a boolean property.
this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided ( filter descriptor can be defined by the developer, tht which string,time,int property to match with which condition i.e : Contains, startswith, endswith e.t.c.
and which operator to use [AND/OR] in case of multiple property filter provided.)
Grouping : another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items.
and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well.
Incremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit.
But it can be part of the control with another boolean property to enable it.
Sorting : sorting with 1 or more properties.
List/GridSwitcher : there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview ( each item expanded fully ) or to a gridview ( normal grid like behaviour )
These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it, but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.
?
Please note that many of these features are inspired from Telerik UWP Grid Control but that is rather just a row by row control to show the data, but I was wondering if some of those key features can be implemented in a traditional collectionView which is native to uwp and has the brilliant UI we all know and love, which works great with fluent design obviously by default and users can add animations etc into it if they want.
This can be a very powerful control/page yet looking very good to the eye as well.

The trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement, user prompting, disabling, etc, just as it is in the Windows Store.
In the Windows store, I can choose trial mode for my app, and then pick the number of days I want the trial to last.
From there, everything is taken care of for me.
If the user uninstalls during a trial, it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
If the user uninstalls and installs again later, the developer has no idea.
Adding trial-mode in Windows Phone feels like implement-and-pray.
I absolutely love the Windows Store implementation.
With the two stores combining, can we bring built-in trial mode support to Windows Phone?

With UWP, getting the file count for 8k files using CreateFileQueryWithOptions or GetFilesAsync on a SSD will take 9 seconds.
With WPF, getting the same file count using dirInfo.GetFiles will take 10 milliseconds.

I would like to programmatically set and get the volume for Windows.
If my app is currently playing audio, it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience.
I want my user to stay inside my app.

with new Version 17134 there are problems with function SwitchAsync() and friends.
On IOT devices like RASPBERRY or i-PAN M7 after call of SwitchAsync() you will get black or blue screen and devices reboots.

Currently, the rates/reviews user submitted in Win10 Insider Preview will be disabled later.
And if devs respond to that reviews, it will also be deleted.
This is ridiculous behavior for both users and devs.
If MS will disable rates/reviews sent from Win10 IP, disallow users to rate/review.

Implement a Credentials Locker of credentials, providing secure storage of passwords and keys for one or more users.
This feature should allow per-publisher apps to share credentials.
The app creating the service key should be allowed to define the access type - per-title or per-publisher.

Today I deleted my application Package from the store for my application.
It also deleted all the Meta data associated with it screen shots descripts etc.
My application is in multiple languages so it will  take me about three hours to re-publish all this information.
I do have backups of it on disk thank goodness but still this is a lot of work.
If you delete your app package it should not delete the meta data.
You should also be able to undelete an app package for 24 hours after you delete.
You should also be able make a backup of this information so if it does get delete you can always restore it.
I am totally discouraged that I have to recreate all this information.

When using a ListView bound to a CollectionViewSource with Grouped items, it would be great to have the option to make the Grouped Item selectable/interactive.

Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling, just like the Windows Store.
In the Windows store, I can choose trial mode for my app, and then pick the number of days I want the trial to last.
From there, everything is taken care of for me.
If the user uninstalls during a trial, if even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
Contract this with the Windows Phone world, where we tell you we want trial mode, but we have to track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
If the user uninstalls and installs again later, we have no idea.
For an app that doesn't require a login, so there's no account to tie the usage to, and doesn't have a natural way to limit functionality, adding a trial-mode feels like implement-and-pray.
I absolutely love the Windows Store implementation.
With the two stores combining, can we bring this to Windows Phone?

On all the ... buttom right, where I can share etc I would like to be able to print.
It needs to be and integrated part of the phones functionality, that is why I put it in Framework.
No app-driven solution.
Having a lot of i-gear, iPhone, iPads etc that can print, it is dissappointing not beeing able to use the equipment I already own.
I'm sure a lot of potential customers have the same contemplations but decides to stay on iOS instead of switching.
HP have the ePrint functionality, Apple the Airprint.
Can you not make connection to these devices possible?

With apps increasingly going the encrypted route, our app (EarTrumpet) is finding it harder and harder to retrieve the running appx app's current application icon (i.e.
the icon you see in the taskbar).
Extracting the icon via FindWindow/etc.
APIs is messy and not appropriate for loading scale sensitive assets.
Parsing the PRI is only possible in unencrypted appx scenarios.

I have a parent application that stores files within app space.
Now when I wish to open a file, the launcher asks me to choose a target application.
I would like my application to know when the target application has been closed.
For instance:
MyApp has a file, 'Abc.pdf'.
On opening the file Abc.pdf from MyApp, the launcher provides a list of applications that can open this file.
Assuming i choose PDF Reader, I want MyApp to know when PDF Reader has closed or stopped accessing my file i.e Abc.pdf

I did a research on AudioFrameOutputNode, It is strange that it often generate AudioFrame without any audio data, the AudioFrame's Duration property is 0 miliseconds, but the RelativeTime property is not.
And the RelativeTime, it seems not correct, sometimes the Duration is larger than RelativeTime.
Sometimes, the previous frame's RelativeTime is 00:00:01.500, but the next frame's RelativeTime is 00:00:01.300.
I'm confused, what the **** is that?
!
Also, the AudioGraph can't to be ensure generate 10ms of AudioFrame data, even though I have set the QuantumSizeSelectionMode property to ClosestToDesired.
This is bad for signal analysis scenario.

I have an always on background Desktop Bridge app, that some users might want to be elevated, when it starts at logon.
Add an option to let user do so.
It might make sense to have that option in Task Manager, since it is the tool to control startup tasks in Windows 10.

Change the Store search engine algorithm back, to as it was.
To make it possible to actually find an app by its title.
I have made an app, when I search for it, 10 apps pops up, and my app isn't any of them.
I just chatted to support, they told me that it was because the name was too generic.
Well, the 10 apps showing when I search for the title, has NOTHING to do with the word I searched for, and the search word is the exact title of my app, and yet it doesn't show (not at all!
Not even as number 11 in the list...) Only 10 elements (or so) is shown, and .... omg, this is just nonsens!

Hello, there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone.
If you create a ListView in an HTML UWP app, you can't invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen.
Mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal Windows builds, where it was working as intended.
I found this thread on Github: https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/1654
And I created this thread on the MSDN forum, where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/af38910b-e097-484a-a76a-94fb7880da6b/uwpwinjslistview-items-cannot-be-invoked-after-scrolling-the-listview-with-the-touchscreen?forum=wpdevelop
You can also find a code sample here

Classic Win32 has the option to disable Windows key when using Direct Input and DISCL_NOWINKEY.
This is not available on UWP.

About 90% of my apps can not be found in the store.
I have about 40 apps and around 8 are visible.
Even if I click on the developer name it still does not show all my apps.
If i do a deep link then yes it find the apps and you can download them but it wont find them with keywords or App Name.
This is the same issue for all Windows Stores.
Phone 8.1, Phone 10, Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10.
Every version of Windows does not show my apps.
I actually had one of my apps appear and then disappear a day later.
This is unacceptable and is a strong deterrent to creating apps for Windows.

It is possible for us to get a D3DDevice from MediaStreamSource, as indicated by admins here:
https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/31915711-mediastreamsource-add-way-to-use-imfgetservice-fr
I can verify that this works.
But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface.
So while we can use D3D to do hardware accelerated video decoding, it is not possible to pass the decoded samples (in a surface) to the MF pipeline through MediaStreamSource.
Please add an overload to create a MediaStreamSample from a D3D Surface.
This will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding.

The UWP scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background.
It can only be seen on a dark background.
The UWP scrollbar should change and contrast correctly depending on the form background color...
If white background, scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible

At the moment, there is 1-to-1 relation between companies and countries.
It's OK for small business but what about bigger one?
We have several dev-centers in 3 countries and extra sales-offices in more countries.
Same time, WP7 registration intends we MUST use 1 country only.
Moreover, recently GeoTrust claimed us to cancel US registration (current one) and re-register as Russia.
Indeed, we're discouraged and not happy...

Adding an image editor to CaptureElement control with these options:
- Ability to crop with predefined or custom proportions.
- Ability to change focus.
- Ability to remove the background (transparent background)
- Ability to add filters.
- Ability to rotate.
- Ability to zoom in/ zoom out.
- Ability to save captured image as predefined image types (.jpg, .png...etc).

Hi Dev Team,
is it possible to get an switch for changing between different bluetooth devices.
I know there is one in the notificationcenter to switch bluetooth on and off.
But if you want to switch between different headphones you have to go to the settings app and connect to them directly (Example).
I found no quick way to solve this problem.
Thank you

Current way of initializing ToastContent and TileContent requires multiple lines of inline-initialization which will make the code messy really fast.
Also, the classes that are used for ToastContent don't have good documentations and constructors (usually require user looking up examples for which properties to set).
Proposing creating builders class using Fluent Interfaces/Method Chaining pattern to ease the operation of creating a ToastContent/TileContent for faster development of supporting Toast Notification / Tile pinning.


I'm developing a Windows Universal App, and I'm sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local DB support.
(I already have a database file encrypted by SQL Cipher and I just have to read the records)
I know SQLite support Universal App Development through Nuget in VS2015
But SQLCipher is not - it supports only commercial edition ($899) and I can't afford the expense.
So I tried to find other ways such as Excel, Access, or SQL Server Compact Edition.
Surprisingly, NO ONE OF THEM supports Universal App implementation.
That's ridiculous and I'm sick and tired of finding the way.
Does Microsoft really NOT support local database in developing Universal App?
I can't understand why I'm confused in this situation which is possible on Android or iOS so easy.
In fact, I wonder why MS does not support this FUNDAMENTAL feature, while Android and iOS already does.

At the moment, when a user views an app on the Windows Store, they're automatically shown the other apps by the same developer.
It's not clear what order the other apps are shown in and usually the top three show, with the others only visible if the user clicks for more.
The problem is that the apps that show might not be the developer's biggest or best apps.
I'd like to see the ability to re-order my related apps so I can choose which related apps get promoted first to users.

When declaring a custom Template for ContentDialog, the template root must contain a Border with x:Name="Container" otherwise the ShowAsync method will throw a System.AccessViolationException.
It MUST be done this way:
&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType="ContentDialog"&gt;
    &lt;Border x:Name="Container"&gt;
    &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;

There are a lot of upcoming features to help with Fluent design and they are really great, however to make full use of these the features/xaml/controls need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this.
This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish/must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions.
(See mobile!)

There are several developers using dishonest methods to boost their apps, including fake ratings.
Those apps are as good as useless to consumers (cheap website wrappers etc.)
and still have dozens of maximum ratings shortly after being released.
Those apps get ranked high in the listings and take away the place of the few others that actually are good.
Reporting usually takes several days or more than one week until something actually happens.
Also, I've heard that MS just warns those devs, but even lets them keep obvious fake max ratings.
This just makes me angry as a serious developer!
Suggestion: Introduce a system with "trusted" developers who can release apps as quick and easy as it is now.
New ones should still need manual review by MS employees like it used to be at WP7 times.
And in the case of a dev found to break the rules, ban them completely.
Of course they can come back, but they'll have to re-pay the registration fee again, and when being banned again every week, it won't pay out for them anymore.
I think that users start to notice that app quality in the store actually counts more than quantity, and that's where WP could outperform Android and/or iOS in the future.

I think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps don't fall into any specific section already listed.

Using the fall creator's update version of UWP, it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model, the previous view model is updated with null values.
This is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models.
It doesn't make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed.

This means if editing any text having a non-linearly proportional spacing scheme must be converted to a font that is.
Then the data usually aligns such that one can select it such that the data of interest is within a reticle.
This feature is especially important when dealing with small sets of non-normalized data derived from sundry uncontrollable sources.
With the feature, a column of data may then be selected from a modified copy of a source document and pasted into a spreadsheet where it may be acted upon more efficiently than using a parsing scheme.
These needs which frequent themselves  fall below a benefit/cost requirement pitting the time needed to configure a parse.
So how about making such a capability global in the forth coming distribution of Windows 10?

Windows Phone Silvelight XAPs were signed, so anyone donwloading them through the Store (manual download) could not have easy access to the sources of the app.
Now with Universal apps / WinRT (.appx), our binaries are not longer signed as a whole, any script kiddie can unzip and decompile any app.
That's a huge problem regarding developer investing on the platform.

Currently its very hard to debug Hybrid and Webapps.
When you create a webview you simply cannot see the DOM or any normal information to see whats going on, what goes wrong and why it goes wrong.
Platforms like iOS and Android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser.
When you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop-&gt;Debug.
And voor Android devices you open Chrome and go to "about:devices".
This gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong (and with IE10 a lot can go wrong, IE11 is better but still not as easy to make cross-platform apps run like on Android and iOS).
Having the means to inspect your app or site needs to be improved greatly.
You can now only see the console (but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn't show errors), not even the DOM.
Let alone inspect resources, timeline and html/css/javascript errors.
With frameworks like Angular, Node, jQuery, etc becoming more popular, we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience.

There is currently no way to know if an EmailComposeTask was cancelled or got an error while sending.
I need to be able to tell if the user actually went through with the email to know whether to delete the email text.
Otherwise I have to ask the user if they sent it (poor user experience).

UWP really needs a way to handle master-details situations easily, maybe something like UISplitViewController offered in iOS SDK


I understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the Mailboxes in the phone, but there should be an API to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics, like the number of unread emails, number of important emails, and the total e-mail count.

The existing color picker have a very long height.
Most of the screen a wide, so why not a horizontal layout for ColorPicker.
I know this will be simple, just edit the style, but I can't make it right

My app users are reporting that they can't get information about my durable add-on on the Xbox One and Xbox One S.
When my code checks for the property AddOnLicenses, the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add-on.
We have tried with ExtendedJsonData property but the add-on array is empty too.
We can't determine if the add-on is active and neither the expiration date.
Please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to Xbox users.

We need a way to have a system wide overlay "notification".
It would be much like the Skype for desktop's small call "window" that comes up when you are in a call.
It would be a lot like Facebook Messenger's chat heads.
See: https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/chat-heads-comes-to-facebook-messenger-for-android-works-across-apps-even-without-facebook-home/
This could be used in the new Skype Preview app, and would be EXTREMLY awesome and powerful.
So many things could be done with it.

For the topic, "Using Control Device Objects", are the devices already considered objects?
In this case, is it necessary to have both words in the title if a device is already considered an object?

If you ever selected "ru" and "ru-ru" laguages then it causes Tile localization show the en-us(default) tile localization to show.
When I removed the "ru" language code and published my new version, the old version still remains with "Replaced and unpublished".
Wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version.
 And this causes me very serious problems:
1.
Some of my users will still receive the old version of my app (after weeks).
The store randomly gives the old or the new version of my app.
2.
My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP in the same submission.
The wp7 xap works only on WP7 and the wp8 xap works only for WP8.
 Sometimes the store gives the wrong wp7 version of my app to Windows Phone 8 users.
So I'm very unhappy.
It should be an option to remove the "ru" language code from my app 'language History'.
Currently if you ever mistakenly selected a "ru" language than you will be in a very bad situation forever:
 - You can live with the wrong Tile displayed for Russian language in the Store (the english one) or
 - You can publish an update with the removed "ru" language, but this update will not "fully replace" the old version and you will in truble: 1.)
&amp; 2.
): the store will randomly deliver the old/wrong version of your xap.
I write a lot support ticket on this, but no one really cares on this issue.
The engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following:
1.
Provide a workaround for removing the "ru" language from the language history (I have no need for "ru" culture just for "ru-ru", but there is no way to remove "ru" from the language history if you ever posted your app with "ru" language support)
2.
Or add and implement an AppResLib.dll.xxxx.mui for the "ru" language culture
  In the documentation AppResLib.dll.xxxx.mui exist only for "ru-ru" and not for "ru" culture:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff967550(v=vs.105).aspx

As an early adopter of the platform, I have a number of "test" apps and/or games.
I can't delete or hide them in the dashboard.
This eats up screen real estate and impacts load times.
I contacted support and they can't delete them either (SRX1418420784ID)

It seems StorageFolder.CreateFolder does not support multi-segment path.
For example, "levelAlevelBlevelC".
If we try to use one of those, it answers with a "parameter incorrect" without any details.
Please support multi-segment path for this method or, at least, return a message giving more details.

When an app fails certification, please provide us with the crash logs and allow the custom app's crash reports to be submitted.
We ran into an issue that's not re-creatable on any device that we tested on and somehow was crash-failing on the same device in the certification process.
This can go with the suggestion to allow direct contact with the tester of the app.

Titre:
The xaml engine of UWP should manage complex types for xaml attributes
Hello
SITUATION:
Currently, the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter into account.
That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code:
&lt;local:MovementControl Begin="1,2"/&gt;
where the complex property is Begin and the complex value is "1,2" that represents a position {X=1 ; Y=2}.
SUGGESTION:
I suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode (convert) an instance to and from a string.
By the way, that will be a lot simpler than the WPF's TypeConverter.
DETAILS:
I mean this kind of interface:
namespace System.ComponentModel
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Sets this object's properties/fields from a string, or export this object to an invariant-culture string.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public interface IParsable
void Parse(string value);
string ToInvariantString();
bool TryParse(string value);
And an example of a type that implements this interface:
public class {
public int X;
public int Y;
public void Parse(string value)
var coords = value.Split(',');
this.X = int.Parse(coords[0]);
this.Y = int.Parse(coords[1]);
public string ToInvariantString()
return X.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo) + "," + Y.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo);
public override string ToString() { return ToInvariantString(); }
public bool TryParse(string value)
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
var coords = value.Split(',');
if (coords.Length == 2)
int x, y;
if (int.TryParse(coords[0], System.Globalization.NumberStyles.Integer, NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo, out x))
if (int.TryParse(coords[1], System.Globalization.NumberStyles.Integer, NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo, out y))
this.X = x;
this.Y = y;
return true;
return false;
Here is an example of what the xaml engine can do with this interface:
namespace Windows.UI.Xaml
internal class XamlEngineExample
void testPosition()
instanciateAndInit(typeof(Position), "1,2");
void setValueOfProperty(DependencyProperty property, string value)
instanciateAndInit(property.PropertyType, value);
object instanciateAndInit(Type type, string value)
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
if (instance is IParsable)
var parsableInstance = (IParsable)instance;
parsableInstance.Parse(value);
return parsableInstance;
return instance;
As an information, this is the xaml control that contain the complex attribute/property :
public class MovementControl : TextBox
public static readonly DependencyProperty BeginProperty
= DependencyProperty.Register("Begin", typeof(Position), typeof(MovementControl), new PropertyMetadata(new Position()));
public Position Begin
get { return (Position)GetValue(BeginProperty); }
SetValue(BeginProperty, value);
base.Text = value.ToString();
public MovementControl()
this.Loaded += MovementControl_Loaded;
private void MovementControl_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
base.IsReadOnly = true;
base.Text = this.Begin.ToString();
CONCLUSION:
I hope you will take this suggestion in consideration, since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers.
Of course, it would be even better to make xaml use TypeConverter additionally, for compatibility's sake with WPF.
Thank you
Chris
Remarks:
1.
I already know workarounds using Bindings, but they are not practical, they need more code, and they are semantically incorrect (a binding is not a transcoding/conversion, they are different by nature).
2.
After having tried TypeConverter on UWP, I tried to add implicit operators (casts) to the complex type (Position, here), from and to string, but xaml does not take them into account.
3.
All my tests and researches made be waste two days for nothing.
That would be nice to offer an easy-to-use and well documented technique for this feature (complex attributes).
4.
In my opinion, this feature is really fundamental, much more important to me than many new features that appears regularly.
5.
Tested with VS 2015 under Windows 10.

I would like to have the possibility to schedule a Add-on price Increase.
The users that are already subscribed to the Add-on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price.
What's the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase?
It's not really convenient for developers to create every time a new Add-on when they want to increase the price.

Allow developers to add suggestions to the user's wordflow keyboard.
This will enable developers to add application relevant content as a user types.
i.e Twitter/Facebook can insert hashtags and @ usernames, Calendar applications can insert relevant dates as suggestions.

Developing WIn10 IoT based applications, we are looking for a way to utilize the TabTip keyboard.
To do so, it is crucial we can remove the Close button, or complete TitleBar from the TabTip keyboard.
User interaction depends on it.
Searched up and down to get this done in Windows 10, no success.
Similar has been accomplished in pre.
used Win CE where MS granted more access to source code.
Many Thanks.

I love to run to podcasts.
A lot of apps let you control music, but nonelist podcasts.
I reached out to caledos runner developers and they mentioned no API exists for this.

Now a promotional codes allows his owner to get paid aplication from the store only by 0 $.
It is badly needed a possibility to publish discount codes, where the price of aplication will be lowerd for example 10%, 40%, etc.
Discount codes are a very important marketing too wich is overlooked in the store

Data from my Xamarin Insights analytics is showing a number of exceptions raised by this method.
The documentation doesn't mention them or possible reasons:-
System.UnauthorizedAccessException - The method doesn't require any capabilities since it just prompts the user to add appointment details.
Also the method is always called on the UI thread so no idea why this is thrown
System.ArgumentException (hResult -2147024809) - all parameters are passed through correctly - a valid Appointment object, valid Rect describing the display area
System.ExceptionClass not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)) - no idea!

Pivot and panorama controls should have options to enable/disable wrapping.
Also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect.

Please allow Connected Home feature in Australia region

I would like to have one overview with all reviews for all apps.
At the moment you have to open the reviews for every app, one at the time.
If you have many apps like me (about 40) it takes a lot of time.
Maybe you can add an 'All Apps' option to the 'Page filter' of the reviews.

please make the theme beautiful by making the icons 4d.
instead of tiles , we want something attractive for instance Windows style icons, more than 3 initial screens, customized task-bar, the action and notification center should be glass style or in customized transparency style.
The app list should be in grid style and background should be customized.
The keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on-screen keyboard in windows 7 (desktop).
more the contact list can be make better, as different developer have already made the app .
Please don't neglect this suggestion.I am not saying to copy anyone.
Windows itself is beautiful.
You can Modify the look of Windows 7(desktop) and can apply this on Windows Phone Theme .
Hope u will not disappoint us.

http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003 does not define the aforementioned elements, making the msbuild xml invalid.

too often we come across a word in an app we might not know or we just want to confirm the meaning of it we colud look it up right where u r without the need to exit n go in to another app.

There should be the option to end background tasks from the Windows Device Portal.
But I mostly care about Windows Phone.
I can see the tasks but I can't terminate them


I think we need a chips control as a new feature in the UWP community toolkit
A good web example can be found here
https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview

I would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time.
It should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily.
Think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something.
Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after 15 days if the application is not opened.

Master Panel in MasterDetailsView was intended to be used as PullToRefreshListView because usually, the ListView in Master Panel is dynamically changing, It is often used for showing Collections of Emails, Articles, etc.
So why not include EnablePullToRefresh as a property of MasterDetailsView.
It would save the user a lot of time and effort.

Extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app.
Can you add it to System.IO.Compression?
Frankly speaking, I'm surprised that it was not there from the very beginning.

Camera should work when app is minimized.
If UWP is to take over for Win32 this is basic requirement.
User can't be expected to keep the window maximized.
This makes sense for phones and tablet mode, but for desktop and dedicated use devices it's just a limitation.
IoT supports a single app so it isn't affected, but Windows 10 Mobile is.
We're trying to build a solution based on Windows Mobile that runs a single Assigned Access app.
If that app is minimized (if user needs to run two apps this can happen) the video capture is lost, making our solution useless..
Also a requirement is UWP integration or with or replacement for Windows services.
On the Desktop we need to capture reliably regardless if a user is present..
Issues like this make it hard to use UWP in business use cases.
Also fun bugs like MediaCapture.CapturePhotoToStreamAsync stalling forever when the app is minimize really give us hope for UWP..

Add PinchIn and PinchOut events, they are common events.

FileSavePicker
Let the program select the Dlg-Open-Directory between
1) the last saved-directory (the actual implemented action)
2) the directory defined by SuggestedStartLocation
3) the directory defined by last action with FileOpenPicker
Usecase for 2:
The App knows that it is a totaly new/clear situation
and the best option for the Save-Dlg is the 'SuggestedStartLocation'
Usecase for 3:
User opens file, the Dlg for SaveAs should start in the 'FileOpenPicker-directory'

Developers who do not have access to capable hardware need to have the ability to test Continuum for Phones on the emulator to ensure that the app works as expected.
Please allow developers to test Continuum for Phones on the Windows 10 Mobile emulator.

The idea would be to have a "Try" button on every sample.
This button will generate a ready to use Visual Studio project with the current sample.

Using DeviceInformation::FindAllAsync in my C++/CX application to enumerate existing MIDI ports on the system.
I'm using the result of MidiOutPort::GetDeviceSelector() for the device selector string.
The DeviceInformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names.
A user of yMidi contacted me about this problem.
Hexe2x80x99s using loopMidi, a virtual MIDI loopback from Tobias Erichsen.
http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
The problem is the output port names are enumerated by the UWP API as just MIDI and not the name of the port as defined when they were setup.
Reaper and other desktop programs are displaying the proper name.
Have you seen this behavior before?
Ixe2x80x99m using the property DeviceInformation::Name in my application to display the port name.
I see a DeviceInformation::ItemNameDisplay property, but that seems to be the same as the property Ixe2x80x99m currently using.

I recently browsed the UWP docs and found some interesting APIs about Accessory Management etc.
Since I developed an application which could massively profit from those APIs as they allow volume control etc, I wanted to use them.
Unfortunately for me, I cannot use those APIs as they are restricted for use and getting access is only possible with a company developer account which I do not have.
Please allow private developers to access those capabilities.
For me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but I do not want to create a company account for this.
Without APIs you are losing customers to Android/iOS as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume, system theme etc.
Providing thos apps would boost UWp as platform and thus create more possibilities for Users and Developers together.
Current steps are outlined here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account

Beta testers test our apps for free.
It would be nice if when the app/game is published in the marketplace we could include a list of the testers that helped us so they can get the app from free instead of having to buy it.

The UWP provides a couple of options to access files and folder:
 * Classical Win32 API i.e.
_wopen, _wread, FindFirstFile, ... for reading/writing to a file handle, directory look up
 * C stdio i.e.
fopen, fread, fwrite, ...
 * StorageFile, StorageFolder
which is great.
Unfortunately, access is ONLY guaranteed via StorageFile, StorageFolder.
This makes it hard to port existing codes that make intensively use of the other API.
Once a StorageFile or StorageFolder is allowed to be accessed by the user, it SHOULD BE accessible across all those different API.
Right now, attempt to do it using Win32 or stdio will result in Permission denied which is total nonsense; basically saying that, "OK, we give you these API options but we dare you to try to use the classical one."

I am thinking about a SDK to allow me to create an "account app".
So like google, facebook, linkedin I want to create contacts, calendar and access to message hub (also writing messages with my account).
Marketplace upload of this kind should be more restricted to avoid problems.

It would be great to have an ability to run application with arguments using WinAppDriver.
For example, run installer from MSI package:
dc.SetCapability("app", @"C:windowssystem32msiexec.exe");
dc.SetCapability("args", @"/i C:installer.msi");
Currently it is possible to do it using Winium, but not possible to do using WinAppDriver.

XAML supports inking so that a user can handwrite directly into a textbox using ink, which is then converted automatically into text.
This was demo'd in one of the apps at the Build 2016 event in London.
It would be very useful to add this feature into Hosted Web Apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a Hosted Web App.

Advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application.
Having an API allowing getting the color of the pixels under a pointer (eventually throttled/async and only when having pointer capture on) would increase the expressiveness of the creation tools in UWP applications.
Another API enabling this use case would be to allow capturing a bitmap of an area of the display.

Above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers

With Project Rome I can discover devices of others, connect with them, and launch apps or leverage app services once consent has been established.

Since we are passing a string via the x:Bind attribute to some UI controls, it would be nice if we could make the binding to a ReadonlySpan&lt;T&gt; so we avoid allocations.
This can be very benefitial in datatemplates in Listviews and Gridviews.

i want to open the developer option to run file transfering mode

The GZipStream class should be available for Windows Phone developers, so we don't have to rely on 3rd party libraries to compress and decompress streams.

Control for Infinite scroll as in  Windows 10 Calendar ?

There is no exposed SelectBox control as far as it appears, even though it is used in Microsoft's apps like Settings.
Can you make it available to developers?

Please bring the DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly method in Universal Apps just like in WPF.

Attempted Cortana use by end user feedback to app developer via store account.
Users attempt to control apps via Cortana saying things the app developer didn't anticipate but which probably make sense.
When Cortana has an expression that it doesn't "understand" based on the available expressions registered, but Cortana does recognize an app name, it would be great if the user's expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future.
This creates a feedback loop that makes Cortana appear smarter and smarter.

Intellisense for Windows.Devices.I2c classes, such as I2cController, expose &lt;sup&gt; tags making reading Intellisense tips difficult and time consuming.
e.g: "Represents the I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C controller for the system"


Make the logic of the MapsDirectionTask equal from the one used within the Bing search.
In fact in the second case the "directions" toolbar start the navigation app while in all the app using MapsDirectionTask the toolbar button of the same name let the user go back to a previous page asking dor start - end point, while the launch of a navigation app is made in done by a different toolbar button in that previous page.
I think that it is not nice to give a different user experience.

Attempting to utilize the Windows UCRT SDK (...Windows Kits10Include10.0.15063.0ucrt) to evaluate Clang on Windows, I was immediately facing an unexpected wall, in the form of an undisclosed and unexpected dependency on Microsoft's Visual Studio.
Apparently even the simplest C program will not be able to compile (as soon as you include any standard C header), because they all seem to end-up attempting to #include &lt;vcruntime.h&gt; (which is not part of the UCRT).
My questions are:
1.
Is there a way to utilize the Windows Universal C RTL SDK withOUT Visual Studio?
2.
If it is not intended, why then is it not called "Windows CRT for Microsoft VC" - what am I missing, and is it really legal/appropriate?

We need Windows Phone to synchronize its clock via the internet.
In some countries this does not work via provider services.

Using the Windows10SInstaller5932 when converting an Intune Managed Windows 10 Education device we are prompted during the initial configuration to set a PIN (Windows Hello) despite having this feature disabled via Intune policy.
A clean Windows 10S installation from ISO does not appear to experience this issue.

I'm currently using a controller mapper like Xpadder and JoyXoff with my Xbox 360 controller.
Everytime I open a UWP app, both Xpadder and the app recognize input thus doubling the signal.

UWP should allow developer to have more choice about when to enable the console mode.
For example, if user click the app icon, the app run in gui mode, but if user run the app by console with arguments, app can run as in console mode.
The pseudocode below shows the basal conception:
//Package.appxmanifest
&lt;Applications&gt;
   &lt;Application desktop4:Subsystem="windows" iot2:Subsystem="windows"&gt;
   xe2x80xa6xe2x80xa6
    &lt;Extensions&gt;
         &lt;uap5:AppExecutionAlias desktop4:Subsystem="console" iot2:Subsystem="console"&gt;
// main
static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
 tif(args.Length==0)
                    global::Windows.UI.Xaml.Application.Start((p) =&gt; new App());
t}else
                    //todo: cmd mode
        }
    }

The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI and " Services " ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.
It will make UWP more powerful like win32 and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps like  " Universal Copy " and 'Native Clipboard" .
I am adding some screenshots too.
You can install those  Android apps yourself.

I really want the Universal Apps to grow more powerful.
I hope you guys consider about these APIs.
Specially the Overlay/Float UI

Currently there is no way to prevent MenuFlyout from closing when user click any of its items.
I'm not even sure if it is not a bug, because setting args.Cancel in Closing event is not working.

Would like to change the view of the contact being displayed.
In the current view, I can hardly see the contact number or anything that I would like to focus.
If there is a way to change the Data Template for the list and details of a contact that would be great.
Also I would like to add more extension points to the Contact Details that are currently captured.
That I suppose is currently not possible.

Example.
A GATT notification arrives from a sensor.
We only get 30 seconds to do something with it.
We want to tag the location but GPS takes longer than that to lock.
So either enable longer running of tasks or perhaps some kind of callback mechanism after initiating a GPS request in the background.

The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images.
Developers should be able to create WP images that are tailored to be in a specific state, and manage those image snapshots.
Hyper-V is a powerful VM management tool, and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them, allowing developers to save the current state of the VM (e.g., to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it, either for one app or multiple) or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the VM.
Emulator image tooling should be expanded to include the following:
- Create a new developer VM image (from one of the base images)
- Delete a created developer VM image
- Be able to add/remove developer VM images from the Visual Studio device/emulator list
- Additional tooling in the emulator to allow for snapshot management of developer VM images
Under this suggestion, the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base/standard images, this suggestion is only for adding additional images.

It can happen that sometimes we do need a control to store a list of pages/elements that looks like a Pivot control but with a infinite list of pages/elements.
So, I think the tab (header) control of Microsoft Edge can be reused with :
* A list of elements (with an icon/title/close button)
* A possible template for previewing element (like a small window)
* A plus button to add more elements
* And maybe other buttons

Hey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/PC

System.Diagnostics.Trace is not available in Windows Store Apps.
This prevents (or at least makes it hard) to write debugging output to a file.
When debugging certain types of code (especially loops), it can be much easier to view the output in an external file.
Please make this functionality available to app developers again so that we can have the same debugging tools as other developers.

MS Edge is not bad however people have different requirements for web browsers.
The current WebAPIs are too limited for developers to create a new browser.
You should give people more freedom and more APIs to create new browsers.
And please don't always use security risk as excuse for not allowing people to create more creative apps than Edge.
I'd like to suggest that creating APIs for:
1, Allowing specify proxies in third-party apps.
2, More events support for WebView: for example, gesture support
3, Allowing third-party Apps to processing the network input/output, like handling CSS/Javascript files/image files/stream files.
4, Allowing third-party Apps to manipulate DOM elements.

The Contact class is missing at least one data point, the Anniversary.
Please make sure that any data accessible from the Contact Details page is made available to the Contact class.

Currently UWP have less readable grayscale font smoothing.
It makes UWP apps look worse than desktop apps on standard DPI screens.
Allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look on par with desktop apps.

The only option for capturing audio in windows phone is via the internal microphone which is the default mic for developers.
I think you should provide the option to capture audio with an external mic via the 3.5mm jack(and not through a bluethooth external mic).

it is better if developers can start their app from background, i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification.
for example, an app that notify to users whenever have an emergency situation happens, it will start itself and ring alarm instead of a toast notification like now.

Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification.
The only workaround provided by MSFT is to manually periodically wake up and reschedule a bunch of notifications ahead of time.
But this is simply not an elegant solution...
It could result in creating hundreds of notifications manually and, what if the user doesn't open the app often and meanwhile disable the app's background task entirely?

Should show temperature data on device portal.

Today's world where Java is every where I don't know why WP does not support java based applications and why Microsoft haven't provided any way to develop WP applications in Java.

Currently (Windows Phone 8.1)  if you store your credentials in the PasswordVault, they aren't deleted on app uninstall, so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available.
I think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall.

To reproduce:
- Run some media player, e.g.
Groove, start playback and press volume button, you will see SystemMediaTransportControls with @Title1
- Run any other player or app with SMTC support, it will capture SMTC and you will see @Title2 instead of @Title1
- Close second app (swipe it up to terminate)
Result: on desktop SMTC will show @Title1 again, but on Windows 10 Mobile SMTC will disappear.
First app will have valid instance of SMTC, it just will not be visible.

The DirectManipulationCompleted event of the ScrollViewer fires too late - it only gets called when the animation of the scrolling finishes.
What would be really helpful is to provide an event (maybe something like DirectManipulationCompleting) that would fire as soon as the pointer is released (e.g.
finger lifts up from screen).

Settings, current live tile Size , and More

provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles won't get collapsed accidentally.

I found that PhoneTriggerType enum includes useful triggers except the trigger when a call is received.
This will allow other apps to access who is calling and possibly mirror the notification to other devices.

Would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers.
There exist a couple of UWP libraries , but their purpose is not to show beautifully designed apps implementing the material design principles of the framework.
The open source platform IONIC has such a market place and I think it's great !
!
Please see examples below of what i regards as good examples of starter apps to get you going in UWP.

Windows Phone 8 may have 3 new resolutions, but it only actually has two aspect ratios, 150% scaling and 160% scaling (accessible through App.Current.Host.Content.ScaleFactor).
Because WVGA and WXGA are the same aspect ratio, and because the website is a giant PITA in uploading images, you have to take and submit 3 screenshots per actual screenshot per language.
4 screenshots in two languages turns into 24 screenshots, which is totally nuts.
If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and 720P images, and then autoscaling the WXGA images down to WVGA through an image handler.
That would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app.

Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.
Hyper-V isolation has benefits, but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation, performance as well as stability.
A simple check of the Docker for Windows issues board ( https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues ) shows a large imbalance of Windows 10 and Hyper-V isolation related issued, where the Windows Server 2016 issues are much less common.
I have Docker build scripts that build 5 Docker images, this script runs in 1 minute and 40 seconds on WIndows Server 2016, but takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds on Windows 10 and has rather frequent issues related to timeouts and hangs.
Please un-hamstring Windows 10 and support Process Isolation for Containers.

Windows is the only platform that doesn't support this natively.
Even the iPhone has had this for almost eight years.
I have been experiencing tons of system crashes recently, so I disabling my third-party loopback driver to see if it helps, but this means I lose this functionality.
Not having these APIs means I cannot as a developer make an app that uses the Surface touch screen to control music software.
The one in the store (yMidi) requires a third party driver.
Android and iOS have popular apps that do this.
Raspberry Pi and Arduino have countless MIDI projects on GitHub.
Windows is literally the only platform that restricts musicians in this way.
If you think I'm the only one that cares about this, I encourage you to survey musicians and producers - they just don't go on these feedback sites, but lots of people want better MIDI support from Windows.

We can't take photos on apps made by JavaScript with Windows Phone 8.1!

As far as I can tell, the DataGrid does not support incremental loading.
Working with big datasets and remote databases this is an essential feature.

In code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer Windows 10 builds (using ApiInformation) so that code can use new features, while gracefully degrading on older builds.
However, there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in ResourceDictionary files or embedded directly into the page XAML.
If you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value, anyone opening the app in an older Win 10 build will immediately crash.
So there should be a way to either swap out style XAML RsourceDictionary files and/or pieces of XAML depending on which Windows build you're on (or feature detection), or else force the XAML rendering to ignore properties and enumerations in the style page that are not part of the current build.

I recently stopped developing for windows phone/dev and closed my account.
I don't currently have plans to come back, however, the agent told me that if I do ever return I cannot use the same email address.
I understand that you don't want someone opening and closing accounts frequently, but I've used this email address for 15+ years and if I do decide to return to develop for the platform I hope that you support this in the future as I won't want to create a bogus email just to sign up!
Perhaps ensuring a 1 year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly.

Is not news that Window mobile won't have a chance against the major OSs out in the market, so I was thinking "why try to implement something new, when what is out there can be used for good on Microsoft side?"
So this I have been thinking so far:
Microsoft have a good amount of apps on the Google Play Store.
They have a great launcher, Cortana, Outlook, Office for mobile and so on.
Why don't build a phone powered by Android but running customized by Microsoft itself.
Read this out: Having a phone that can link to your pc is something cool and having a phone that even though is build on Android it can be renamed because of its customization something like Surface Os, like One Plus call Oxygen Os to their customization of Android.
Also, if Cortana can read/reply messages from the phone, why not link that API or process (not sure if those are the words needed for my idea) to the Messaging app that comes built-in on W10?
This is what I would do if given the oportunity and power: Try to establish a partnership with HTC for the hardware departmnet or maybe FoxConn, have them build a phone with the little logo of Android under the new Windows logo in chrome color; customize to run Microsoft apps natively (obviously have the Google apps just to comply with Google requirements and also give the users the options to decide wether or not to use them; put Edge as the primary web browser (Edge so far is awesome on mobile and pc) then having Cortana as primary assistant like Samsung do with Bixby and establish the connections between the devices (pc and mobile) that are linked to the microsoft account of the user; put down a great investment on marketing the product and its abiltiy to link your phone to your mobile without needing to spend a lot of money in a new computer, allowing to work with whatever W10 device the consumer have(this will be different than Apple which requires people to buy only their products to have the same benefits) and most of all not limiting this to Surface devices only because if this happens it will be no difference to what Apple is doing and I don't thinks that people are willing to spent a thousand dollars in something barely new to them.
Besides, it will have a broader reach to consumers.
How many consumers runs W10 on their PCs or laptops?
A lot!
And also, it will be great the Microsoft expands it services internationally, like for example Cortana which it barely works in regions outside the US.
To wrap this up: I really have faith in what Microsoft and doing, and Cortana, while it needs improvement, it can prove to be a great competitor that what's out in the market but being limited to few regions it just not useful and that sucks.
I hope that Microsoft pay attention to this and do something because I would like to see them making its way in the mobile department.
PD: All Microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on Windows.

Please, give us the possibility to delete add-ons (with, without subscriptions etc) right in the Web GUI of the partner center.
Right now, if you want to delete an addon in the partner center (which you have created there), you have to:
Read and follow all the required manuals to delete an add-on with azure ad integration.
Create an account, wired app to it, get token, app-secret, tenantId etc.
Entered the needed ID also in the partner-center's section "product collections" and "adminstrator agreement".
Search desperatly for a complete c# uwp exambple how to connect and proceed with a follow up request.
Try to delete the addon finally via c# and deleteasync requests
Getting meaningless errors, because the above is so error prone and no complete example for uwp exists.

Cach Out PubCenter Revenus With Check

Currently WP8.1 allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi.
For security reasons, I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi, then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone.
Then, when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect, it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too.
How's that for security?
Lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available.
If the phone is stolen, and it is password locked, it's still possible to take photos (if enabled).
The thief may take a photo, but if only the wifi backup option is enabled, but there is no wifi available for the phone, then the picture stays in the phone.
But if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data, then it would be available for the phone's real owner.
The thief could take a picture of him/herself (then it can be given to police) and/or give idea of his/her location.

There has been a huge spike in spammers scraping the Windows Store website for apps' support email.
The automated script leaves a 5 star review and asks that you do the same for their app.
Here is an example:
*****************************************
Hello Lancelot Software,
What if we will exchange apps reviews?
I recenlty rated your app https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hacked/9nblggh6850j with 5 stars and caption and text 'Great Tool' / 'I will admit that installing this app was an ordeal.
I want to thank Lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me.
I like the ease of the app and recommend this app to all.
'.
Please rate my app https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/openoffice-writer/9nblggh52q7c .
Thank you!
Best,
Tom
*****************************************
I have largely ignored this is the past because it was minimal, but someone is finding good success with it so they're hammering everyone.
Personally I'm getting 2-3 a day from different source email addresses.
Removing the support email from the webpage would not hinder the user as they can see it via the Windows Store app.

I think that would be useful if we can get the number of reviews and avarage rating by country in the Dev Center Report.

Says:
"The SSL strength actually negotiated using ConnectAsync or UpgradeToSslAsync can be determined by getting the StreamSocketinformation.ProtectionLevel property."
If using SocketProtectionLevel.Tls12 and server uses tls 1.1, the value is SocketProtectionLevel.Tls12, not SocketProtectionLevel.Tls11 as expected.
This makes it very difficult to enforce latest tls version when there's no way of knowing the actual protection level.
We need to be able to do this to avoid disaster when next POODLE comes along.

Now that both services were migrated to NET Standard, it'd be great to have implementations for the .NET Framework, along with the already existing ones for UWP.
The required changes would be coding the implementation of the four platform-dependent interfaces that these services depend on.

Need an option to remove unused variables in cs file for re factoring.

When you have a text editor, with unsaved changes, the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing.
This is not possible on UWP.
Please add option to do that on UWP desktop apps.

Just like an user have right for review, so should developers be able to RESPOND TO EACH AND EVERY REVIEWS submitted to the Store.
If an user plans to opt out from a response from developer, DO NOT EMAIL THE USER A RESPONSE, but STILL ALLOW A RESPONSE TO MADE PUBLICLY VISIBLE.
Needless to say why, because the current implementation is being exploited to submit false reviews and not allowing the developers to respond.

Bring back support for IPX/SPX or at the very least provide compatible drivers (either through the Microsoft Website or as a legacy feature) that can be installed on Windows 10.

As the current time sync does not work correctly (at least in The Netherlands) i want the option to build my own.

Currently there is no way to collect console logs of an installed UWP app from xbox.
It would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in HTTP monitor tab.
Also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug.

The WebView control immediately responds in the negative when a page calls window.confirm(), and with `null` for window.prompt().
There's no apparent way for UWP application developers to implement support for these methods themselves; ScriptNotify can't be used to block JS execution waiting for user input.
While obviously these APIs are frowned upon in today's day and age, it's a problem when WebView cannot be pointed at an existing web page without causing surprising behaviour.
Ideally, the Edge browser implementation of these controls would be carried over to apps using the WebView control, but alternatively new events could be created to allow authors to handle the responses programmatically however they choose.

When using an html &lt;select&gt; element with &lt;option&gt; that have long text, the WebBrowser control does not wrap the text, and as a result the options can get truncated.
In certain circumstances, this makes the control unusable as one cannot differentiate between different items in the list.
In Internet Explorer on the same device, the menu items wrap as expected.
Android and other devices (including Internet Explorer on WP) do wrap the items so the user can see the full content of the items.
More details:

I would be extremely useful in a variety of app types to be notified upon call started and ended events, at least be able to check whether or not the device is being used for a phonecall.

IoT introduced the Windows.System.ProcessLauncher for starting arbitrary programs (like Process.Start in .NET).
Add this for Side-loaded or enterprise distributed apps on Desktop devices

Having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea.
But the xbox one doesn't provide any diagnostics data of apps (e.g.
memory CPU consumption, etc).
There is a section for that in the device portal but there is currently not data.

The era of connected TV is here.
Windows developers need APIs to control TV tuners and display of other digital media on the same screen at the same time

Windows Phone has for some time some unfortunate issues with any timer based apps, where the background events do not fire in an accurate and precise point in time.
It would be helpful if APIs could be provided for both background and foreground apps.
Including a possible ContentDialog which could be displayed even outside the app for custom actions when an alarm is completed.
And a possible "Time Remaining" label which could be displayed in the Action Centre.

i dont want use UAC, is a security risk.
but i want have metro apps

Sorry if I sound bitter but I must say it's very frustrating developing for w10 mobile at the moment, even if the you get good reviews the chance of them being displayed in the store is very slim due to the version fragmentation.
As I understand it insider reviews that aren't on the slow ring are removed, even worse they're deleted permanently from even the Developer Dashboard.
People took time to write thoughtful reviews and they're simply deleted.
I've started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them
I've had over fifty 4+ star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again.
I see the point that insiders shouldn't bring down the ratings of the app if the OS is to blame.... but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews.
Old Windows Phone 8.1 retain their status of being the most highly rated just because of this.
What's the point of having a rule if that means there's too few reviews and no point for most people to post reviews at all?
I'm not quite sure what a good solution is, you cold allow only 3+ reviews for fast insiders but I guess that might skew reviews too positively.
Or why not let the text review stand even if the rating doesn't count?
At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version.
As it is getting an accurately impressions of apps through reviews doesn't seem feasible.
At the very least don't delete reviews from the dev center even if they're not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc

now it's readonly

When you add items to the map and then pan the map the items aren't following the map but are lagging behind.
If you add more than a few, like 25+ the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins/controls are in the right position.
This is only happening in Universal apps if we make a Silverlight app the pins are following the map like they should even if more than a few hundred items are added.
There are lot's of posts about this around the Internet, the answer from Microsoft in this thread is very interesting and disappointing

While understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible, but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time, investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the C++ requirement.

As a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device.
This means access to call-history, text messages, and everything that is exposed to OEMs who have this control over our personal devices but as developers we don't.
Group Contacts app under Bizmonger is a perfect example of a replacement for the default phone app that I wrote for my own personal use.
Yet, I do not have access to many APIs even though I was originally building the app for myself.
Perhaps, more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions.
I'm just saying...

We really need Assembly Binding Redirection (or Publisher Policies) is Windows Phone!
!
Lets say you have a library A that the developer strongly signed.
Now let's say you have two other libs, B and C, and both of these depend on A.
If B and C were to be built with different versions of A, how will he use B and C on our projects?
In the .NET Full Framework, we would use a .config file to make Assembly Binding Redirection (normally, we would point all versions of A to its most recent version), but this is not possible right now in Windows Phone... :(
As far as I can now, this affects the whole Silverlight Framework, not just Windows Phone...

Apparently Windows 8.1 HTML store apps do not support IndexedDB, so developers are using ad-hoc solutions on top of SQLite:http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/07/02/writing-a-sqlite-wrapper-component-for-universal-windows-apps/
This is a poor state of affairs for the web platform, since IndexedDB has long replaced WebSQL as the preferred way to store user data.
So it should be supported in store apps.

I don't know if Satya Nadella ever took a look into the Windows Store, but here are short facts:
- 80-100% of Red Stripe deals apps are games
- 80-90% of Featured apps are games or entertainment
- Productivity and Tools are not even listed as top categories at the end of the front page.
If you think about productivity, this is not a way to do it.
As I guess that games are revenue leader and they are not going away soon, at least have featured corner and deals for serious apps, and give overall more space.
Also having games and apps category when apps are heavily dominated by entertainment apps is nearly useless and you need to have new categories - "fun" "productivity"

The ApplicationViewMode CompactOverlay (also known as "Picture-in-Picture", "Mini-Mode" or "Always-on-top") for UWP apps has a maximum window size, which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height.
I got several user feedback if I could provide a larger compact overlay.
Unfortunately I can not, since this is limited through Windows.
Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit?
(Other than "our product manager said 500 pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact"xf0x9fx98x8b)
Could you please increase the maximum size or better: remove it at all!
Seems my users would prefer watching a video always-on-top with a larger size.
Note: You can check Window's current maximum size for compact overlay through the "Movies &amp; TV" app.
It's mini mode has exactly the same limitation.


I have a disk imaging application (which I have already converted) that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).
It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk.
It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.
Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.
There are thousands of apps out there that probably aren't converted for similar reasons.

XmlnsDefinitionAttribute is an absolutely great attribute for Control Library developers.
It allows the developers of that control library to greatly simplify the xaml by reducing the number of XMLNS declarations they need.
The only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in XAML (not just controls but other types too), in the same namespace, creating a very ugly unwieldy API to code against.
If you use a 3rd party control library or you're a control library vendor, you should vote for this.
It'll save you a lot of typing, looking for controls and types etc.

We should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots, it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing.

Currently it is difficult to re-theme a section of the UI that involves flyouts by following the lightweight styling guide to override resources (i.e.
placing a resource with the same key in the Resources of the element at the root of that UI section).
ThemeResources inside flyouts attached to items in the sub-tree are not updated.
However, it appears that if the RequestedTheme of the root element is updated then the flyouts are updated to follow that theme, so it seems to have been acknowledged that flyouts should inherit theme resources through their Target, so I suggest that this should be implemented.
If they could also inherit styles with a TargetType but no explicit key, that would be very useful as well.
Also, the same behaviour should apply to the items panel of a ComboBox.
I don't really understand why it doesn't work at the moment because as far as I can see it uses a Popup which I think should inherit theme resources.
At the moment I think the difficulty of styling UWP apps is one of UWP's biggest weakness, especially compared to web apps.
Implementing the above suggestion would be a small step towards recitfying this weakness.

XAML in Windows 8.1 has many text layout features - with one glaring exception: there is no support for hyphenation.
Now, this may not be so bad in English, which has relatively short words, but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words.
Words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed - especially on small screens.
With the new Universal App Platform in Windows, this is going to become far more relevant, as you no longer know what size you app can run at.
This would also bring feature parity with HTML/JS apps, which already have hyphenation support.

Allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image they're drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally/vertically.
This allows for easier editing when a 45 degree angle or another angle is needed.
You could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier.
At least for me.

Please allow to set the display language of MapControl to one different from Windows display language.
The Windows display language of my computer is set to en-US, because I am an app developer and most app problems and solutions are written in English.
However, I am developing a Chinese (zh-TW) app using MapControl on my computer.
Unfortunately, we can't set the MapControl language by programming to a specific value.
MapControl always uses the Windows display language.
It is inconvenient for me to debug a Chinese app with MapControl, while my favorite Windows display languages is en-US.

Although the Native Screenshot feature is reported to not be available until Windows Phone 8, I have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact Windows Phone 7 apps as well.
Since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my Windows Phone 7 app, I do not consider this off topic.
I am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps.
I am concerned about security and DRM issues.
Will Microsoft provide an API that will allow us to:
1.
Disable the feature entirely.
2.
Programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app.
3.
Detect when there is a screen shot attempt so we can programmatically not display, obscure, or watermark our graphics.
If so, what happens to existing Windows Phone 7 apps that run on a Windows Phone 8 device?
Will screen shots work by default for Windows Phone 7 apps?
If so, and there is no API to restrict usage for existing Windows Phone 7 app, but there will be an API to restrict functionality for Windows Phone 8 app, I may want to wait for Windows Phone 8 before deploying my app.

I would like to have better access to Lockscreen so that I can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed, any custom content like photos or news, wallpaper.
It should also allow a timer based updation.

I currently use the CodedUI testing framework as it allows me to logon to IE as a different user/password.
The sites that we test use Windows Authentication and ASP.NET Impersonation as they run on an intranet.
We do not use "Basic" authentication so cannot pass credentials on the url.
I would prefer to use the WebDriver/Selenium approach but it does not support our logon scenario.
We frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc.
This means that we are forces to use the CodedUI framework.
Can Windows logon capability be added to your WebDriver efforts please?

Let's say I have a couple of views and their related viewmodels.
The viewmodels have some common logic and common properties that I'd like to put in a base view model class to not repeat myself.
And if I have 5 viewmodels deriving from my base view model, and my base view model has the boolean IsLoading property, I want to be able to x:Bind to this IsLoading property from each view.

I want to be nice about this one... but, seriously?
Why is it impossible to get the Contact designated by the system as "Me", for the purposes of getting "my" current Picture?
Why should I have to implement a ContactPicker to make the user choose, or implement the Live SDK and force them to log in, when the phone already knows?

Hello,
According to the MSDN manual (https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-ch/library/windows/apps/br212849) there should be a glyph "Activity" (&lt;badge value="activity"/&gt;).
Unfortunately, the glyph "activity" is never displayed on the tile.
But when I'm using any other glyph (such as "alarm", "alert", "attention"), it is properly displayed.
Furthermore, the gyph "error" can also not be used.
Instead, the glyph "attention" is shown.
See here for details on this issue:https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/755869a1-53d4-410e-a61f-3a21e1a97caa/possible-bug-in-badge-elements-activity-glyph?forum=wpdevelop
Would be great to have these bugs fixed soon.
Thanks and best regards,
Patrick

Just posted idea for SQL Server SqlConnection / SqlCommand composition here: https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/3128348/requesting-url-callback-for-sqlconnection-sqlcommand-for-async-completion-while-party-requesting-connection-exits-process-upon-begin
For consistency sakes requesting same from all async awaitable(s).
In an ideal world I should be able to invoke a task and than, optionally, send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it.
The "other" side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of its progress, unless the platform offers capabilities, such as SQL Server X-Event, Windows Application Event Log, or some form of notification.
Optionally the worker side of async / awaitable should accept notification URI in conjunction with Type, which ( the Type itself ) may or may not exist on the target of execution, in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical HTTP message... the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format, potentially by polling yet another resource.

I want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution, regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows.
For instance, when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.
This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution (1280x720).
TrySetDisableLayoutScaling on the ApplicationViewScaling Class looks perfect, but only works for Xbox.
Can this be implemented for the Hololens?

In the exceptions section of the dashboard, you can view your hangs and exceptions.
When you view an exception, you get a completely useless stacktrace with only hex values for function names because of optimization.
We can't use that at all.

When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone 8 on Nokia Lumia 1350 (OS 8.0.10517.150) I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document (using #name) doesn't work from pages using frameset (doctype is correctly set to HTML 4.01 supporting framesets).
To verify, try clicking on any method in Java Javadoc, for example open http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ and click through -&gt; java.applet -&gt; AppletContext -&gt; getApplet.
Java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets don't work.

Full unsafe code support would:
1) Allow more code to be shared across platforms, and
2) Increase the performance of applications that needed it.
Here's a use case example:
I'm the author of  BEPUphysics, a real-time simulation library.
I wish to support many platforms as best I can with as much common code as possible.
Unfortunately, in the current situation, I can't have the best of both worlds.
If my goal is optimal performance, I must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low-level queries and data structures.
On the other hand, if my goal is as much common code as possible, I'm forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator, crippling all of the other platforms.
Over time, these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isn't as fast as it could be.
While using C++ could provide the necessary access and performance, many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine-grained that dropping to C++ from C# repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower.
(A full native implementation would address the performance side of things, but I can't justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform.
It would also destroy a lot of value for the C#-based users of the library.)
Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn't allow unsafe code, enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the PC.
This would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone.

Visual Studio 2015 now lets developers use Grunt and Bower in certain projects.
This is an excellent feature, but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app.
It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project, rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project.
It makes sense to disallow universal C#/Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows 8 or only target Windows Phone.
However, it is extremely unlikely that a script installed from Bower will ever differentiate between the two.
Therefore, there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower, instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects.

You know it for sure: one developer produces great software like Google Chrome, Paint.net or many others.
The other developers try to force customers to use their software, for example M$ with Edge and "Paint 3D".
M$ even tries to pay customers to use Bing &amp; Edge.
This is the crezy idea:
M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves, because it's just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.
**** of customers by M$ with forced and uncompetitive software like Edge, Paint 3D, Windows Update which usually hangs, produces less stable Windows and needs 1000 times more time to konw what should be updated than MacOS or Linux, and all the other useless stuff will be a bad strategy in the medium term.
If necessary, you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors - at least at school, so the can learn how great Software has to feel and look like.
The could start with small things like this feedback "Form" which is annoying, too.
M$ just displays 4 lines.
It feels like M$ is begging the customers to send no feedback because M$ hates it but must do something.
Therefore, act as usual: offer the cheapest "solution".
Kind regards,
Thomas

Consider the following flow, which I just did and is causing me massive headaches.
Sign up for Azure Mobile Service
integrate using the documentation for WP8 (key: uses HttpNotificationChannel)
Integrate a BackgroundDownloader in to your app, use the MSDN doco for guidance
Now add a toast notification to your Downloader.
Everything compiles, deploys, and executes exactly as you'd expect on your device and your emulator.
Now submit for certification.
Fail.
why?
you have to be WNS to use the ToastNotificationManager and other (new) APIs
Cool, switch to WNS.
Submit for cert.
FAIL.
You can't use HttpNotificationChannel if you're using WNS.
Fumble your way through figuring out how to use AMS w/o HttpNotificationChannel, since it's not in the quick start doco for AMS.
Submit for cert.
FAIL.
That deep-link "pin to start" command you had?
Can't use ShellTile if you're using WNS.
Seriously?
There has GOT to be a better way.
Am I expected to run the cert kit before doing any device/emulator testing?
?

I have a cordova app which works fine on Windows 8.1 platform, but on Windows Phone 8.1. the app crashes frequently after taking multiple pictures.
After profiling the app I found that after calling MediaCapture.capturePhotoToStorageFileAsync method, memory is not released and allocates 10-20 MB with each call.
I've also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on Windows phone:
https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/6629896-cameracaptureui-for-windows-phone-8-1-rt-apps

The fact that we have to go through C++ to exploit such key resources as DX, D2D, DrawingSurfaces in W8, WPF, WP8 is _NOT_ acceptable.
SharpDX proves that those key technologies can be made available to CSharp: I would suggest to either support the project, or to provide your own interface.

On iOS, Android, BLE trackers like Trackr can anonymously make an encrypted connection via other users' devices running the tracking app; ideal for crowd tracking your lost device.
this may be a blocking issue for getting good tracking devices into the platform

When I'm able to set Windows.UI.ViewManagement.StatusBar.BackgroundColor, I would also like to set foreground color of Windows.UI.ViewManagement.StatusBarProgressIndicator.
It is always the accent color and cannot be changed.

Developers need to have good and deep understanding of how UI virtualization works on UWP app

All the documentation on how to call UWP methods are in C# and require the .NET platform.
Is there a low-level C interface as well?
I'm developing a Java application so interop with C# is kinda tricky, while interop Shell32 API or C libraries is pretty easy and straightforward with JNA.

I want to add a context menue for *.jpg files to my app without setting the app as default app for *.jpg files.
For example, my app wants to add the context menue "resize images" for jpg files.
But I don't want to set it as default app for jpgs, as the app isn't capable for viewing images.

  - Same thing on another phone, with same attendee, it crashes.
  =&gt; I have checked and detail from attendee are exactly the same.

Hi Microsoft, My name is Mike Laversuch, I am the product architect for mobile apps development at CACI UK.
We develop enterprise applications for Heath, local authorities and government.
Our largest user has a deployment of 18,000 devices throughout the UK.
I have been looking at options for locking down windows phone 8 for use in an enterprise environment and I have just seen "Kids Corner".
This is uncannily close to an enterprise kiosk mode that we are crying out for on the windows phone platform.
One small adjustment.... allow phone calls to be made as an option and this can be used as an enterprise kiosk environment.
In the enterprise environments we are targetting the companies have the requirement of prevention of installing apps, only running approved apps, no internet access, no text etc.
Kids corner gives us all of this!!!!!!!!
Just re name it "Enterprise Kiosk mode" and add an option to allow phone calls and its there.
Kind regards
Mike Laversuch

I need the screen address(es) of virtual reality goggles in general, as well as their resolution width x height x depth and pitch.
Probably through a direct draw surface(s).
Reason being, I do my own 3d rendering without using DirectX for that video portion of my code, just Locking the screen DirectDraw surface for it's parameters.
Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system, and with this information I can get the job done in a few days.

&lt;!-- Items with Header properties should be also resolve automatically --&gt;

Master-Detail with x:Bind is not working properly.
When you use x:Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView, this problem exists:
1. you change the value in the TextBox
2. you select a new item in the listView
3.
Your changes from 1 are lost, because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus-event of the TextBox was raised.
That means the change was never written back to the original item.
This bug, more description and the code to reproduce it can be found in this blogpost:

I believe scrolling should be improved.
As sometimes when users are viewing a long document, they sometimes might want to skip to the middle/lower section.
But scrolling seems to take a little long..
Thus, this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll, like every 5 scrolls the scrolling speed will increase..

Transferring "large" amounts of data (10kB) takes way to long when transferred via BLE using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large.
Using an BLE-Dongle via HCI where it is(!)
possible to set the min conncetion interval the transfer duration of the same data is approximately four times lower than with native BLE.
So it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors.

The build in WP8 LongListSelector will jump to the last item added, when data loading.
When used in combination with MVVM and sorted data, this will result in the fact that the LLS is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available.
We now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top, after it has been loaded.
Please provide a property to enable/disable this feature.

I Have problems with Contact class on Windows 8.1 and WindowsPhone 8.1
With this code:
var p = new Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactPicker();         p.DesiredFieldsWithContactFieldType.Add(Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactFieldType.Email);
IList&lt;Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact&gt; contacts = await p.PickContactsAsync();

   {
    foreach (Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact c in contacts)
    {
      await new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(c.FirstName + " - " + c.LastName + "
" + c.Id).ShowAsync();
     }
In Windows 8.1 the field LastName is always empty and the field FirstName also contains LastName.

I believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but I want to post it just to show my desire for it.
I am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns "sock: can't identify protocol".
This occurs because /proc/net/tcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as TCP.


Ads should start displaying in an app on the day it is published so the developer can generate revenue immediately.
It's not fair to the developer that ads can sometimes start days or weeks after the app is published.
Many apps have cloud services behind them that cost money and no revenue is generated for up to two weeks in some situations.
How would Microsoft like it if devs were paid two weeks before their app went on the store?

Currently, to interact with a DataGrid's rows, you must specify a SelectionChanged event.
This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items.
Because of this, I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped.
Previously, it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows' style (As mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically), but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP, I am left without this functionality.
My proposed solution is to add a "RowDoubleTapped" event directly to the UWP DataGrid class itself.
I need this to be easily accessible from my XAML code.
This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar "ItemClicked" event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.

When you click on something in IE9 it overlays it with a gray box.
This looks especially bad with controls with rounded elements.
Take a look at the jQuery Mobile demo http://jquerymobile.com/test  on your WP7 to see what I mean.
This also applies to apps written using PhoneGap and so will stifle the burgeoning HTML5 app development.
Please give us the means of turning this feature off.

When notifications are removed from one device, they should be removed from all devices by default.
Developers should have the option to opt-out instead of the option to opt-in.
This makes more sense because it would annoy the consumer more if they have to remove the same notification in EVERY windows 10 device they own.

In the new Windows Store the length of IAP title is limited to 100 characters and the length of IAP description is limited to 200 characters.
Especially the new maximum length of IAP description is ALL TOO SHORT.
This was a braking change since the old Windows Phone Store did not have this kind of limitation.
For example I am currently not able to edit any of my IAP descriptions translated to 14 languages because they exceed the 200 characters limit.
One usage scenario of IAPs is to offer new features to users and in the IAP description it must be possible to describe the new features detaily.
As an example, one of my IAPs lists 10 new features and the total length of those IAP description is about 500 characters currently.
I suggest these new maximum lengths: title 500 characters, description 10000 characters (same as for app description).

If you could provide a link to the PDF invoices for developers that would be perfect.

I think I found a problem in Media Player.
The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app.
In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.
But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.
Why is it so?
I think in first case must be fired ButtonPressed event too like it happens on phone call.
Please add that capability.

 I have tried for over a month now and I am yet to hear from this team.
I do not know what else to do.

The current process is very lengthy and costly for non US developers.
Why can't Microsoft simplify it?
Make it similar if not the same as Google!?!?
!
Having read through the cumbersome process, I am more incline to build FREE apps with subscription rather than getting any money through the Marketplace.
Having to deal with physical paperwork (sending it back and forth) is a step backwards... we are living in a digital world!
There are heaps and HEAPS of really good developers outside of US who really want to contribute to making Windows Phone a preferred choice, so please Microsoft; make it simplier and make it DIGITAL!

For example, if allow to find appointments by end date (start date + duration) we can know what is happening in current moment.

Social networking APIs, like Facebook, are constantly adding new features.
Proving access to the authentication directly (even if it were temporary) would allow applications to use the most up-to-date social networking SDK to provide better features for their users.
A "GrantAccountAccessTask" could, for example, ask the user for temporary access (including what permissions are needed).
If the user did not have an account configured for that provider, they could be given the chance to create one (or simply redirected to the social network providers website).

There needs to be an Alpha Test mechanism available.
I am doing Agile development on a business app and I need to let me boss test the app weekly.
Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this.
My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.
If the Beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem.
As it is, it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner.

Right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self-signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback.

ShowAt show the flyout with the size (width) defined in the style
However ShowAtAsync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style.
I think its a bug.
ShowAtAsync would be more convinient to use but we cannot as the flyout is not size according to its content, but to the width of the attached button.

AdControl on Xbox in Retail Mode crashes app, works fine in Dev Mode or on Desktop &amp; Mobile.
Something has changed in the Microsoft Store Services SDK framework or in the Microsoft Advertising SDK for XAML library that is updated automatically to the Xbox since February 9th 2017.
To repro, download any app from the store which contains ads and it will instantly crash on the spash screen.
I've had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed

When debugging XAML apps, it should be possible to set a breakpoint or tracepoint on an x:Bind and have the debugger stop on the code-gen binding.
The generated bindings code is very large and not easy to follow.
Further, it doesn't even exist until compilation and even then isn't visible to the user in VS.
The idea here is to set a breakpoint or tracepoint in XAML and have VS break on the appropriate code-gen method instead.

If FM radio APIs are brought in, it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well.
This would allow apps to say they were listening to KEXP instead only 93.1 and the station information as well.

The Alarm and Reminder classes in Microsoft.Phone.Scheduler are very limiting and do not allow for any customization.
Ideally these classes would be extended to accept a UserControl object that would be shown instead of the standard Title.
The UserControl should run in the context of the application that created the Alarm or Reminder, and as such would have access to the appropriate view models.
From there the application could be fully launched if desired.

All localization should work like .resw files work - if there is no entry in the app description you should revert to the original entry.
Obviously sometimes it should be considered per sections - like if you don't have any localized pic, default pics are shown, but if you have at least one then those local versions are shown.
There is nothing inherently wrong to localize just UI and not the description, and it is much easier for small developers.

Wireshark shows that the default MaximumAutomaticRedirections is always 5,which is so small in practical.
If the server(s) redirect for 6 times,then the request failes.
Need access to set this property programmatically.

The SerialDevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general, but doubly so when compiling as Native.
The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception:
      public async Task&lt;byte[]&gt; ReadAsync(uint count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            using (var reader = new DataReader(_serialDevice.InputStream))
            {
                var read = await reader.LoadAsync(count).AsTask(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
                var data = new byte[read];
                reader.ReadBytes(data);
                reader.DetachStream();
                return data;
            }
        }
This will reliably result in a BSOD if zero bytes are returned (not clear why LoadAsync isn't blocking either):
      public async Task&lt;byte[]&gt; ReadAsync(uint count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            using (var reader = new DataReader(_serialDevice.InputStream))
            {
                await reader.LoadAsync(count).AsTask(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
                var data = new byte[count];
                reader.ReadBytes(data);
                reader.DetachStream();
                return data;
            }
        }

By using the FileOpenPicker class, we can filter shown files by extensixc3xb3n, but I think we should also be able to filter files by their name,  let's say: "I only want to show pictures whose name start with "ABCD", or whose name ends with " BCD".

Some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason.
They may have been in a country that is not supported for example.
More then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting.
Some people may sell their apps to others.
In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one.

I have had really pathetic experience paying the registration fees first on windows 8 dev center and now on windows 8 phone dev center.
Tried all different cards which worked well on windows 8 store but are continuously getting rejected in windows 8 phone store.
The whole experience of payment is horrible.
Tried paying with HDFC, ICICI.
The payment iframe for bank is not visible half of the time.
Microsoft should seriously look into getting rid of Symantec for all these payment stuff.
I can see numerous people facing these problems on web across.

Windows Phone 8 already handles some media type (MIME) NFC tags, but it could be improved upon substantially.
We have developed a dynamic NFC tag that can broadcast NDEF Message up to 4 GB in size, and change the contents on demand.
With this amount of space, we can share MP3 files, photographs, and other data that is typically too large to fit on an NFC tag.
The problem is that Windows Phone 8 seems to have an artificial limit of 4 KB for how large of an NFC tag it can read.
We would like to see this limit raised, or removed entirely, to allow for more creative NFC solutions to be produced.
We would be happy to provide test units of our DTAG100 dynamic NFC tag (www.dtag100.com) to Microsoft and the developers responsible for expanding the NFC stack of Windows Phone 8.
We have begun to push the limits of what NFC can do with this hardware but we need mobile operating systems to push with us.

It would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still.
If you have seen the google store they show active installations more prominently than total download count - and that actually makes sense considering the amount of trash apps going around in all the phone o/s .

Currently the only way to set BackgroundDownloader's header is by SetHeader method, unfortunately once you set the heder value, you cannot clear it as the method:
&gt;This method allows the caller to set request headers.
This method can be called multiple times for the same header.
The values will then be concatenated.
The problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader, if the server requires to send request via headers, we are not able to downloaded files/items within one downloader, every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers.
Of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification.

Hello,
My name is Raja from India.
Currently Microsoft doesn't have any specific support for beacons.
Beacons are the next generation rulers in the market.
As a windows developer, I don't see a good future for windows here,
When ever I contact any manufacturer of beacons, they basically hesitate to support windows, because the limitation in the windows featurest.
We don;t have any separate library for beacons.
Beacon also considered as normal bluetooth device.
Currently I can only read (that too has many limitations) , I can't communicate.
This is a big drawback.
We expected this will be solved in windows 10 , but not yet.
Till now many clients for my company left out windows and they moved to iOS and Android.
If this is going to continue, then windows will face huge drawback.
I have raised many questions related to this in community forum.
There was no input from there.
I'm not sure you guys will have a look on this quickly or not.
Even if you have a look I'm not sure about your priority.
Windows wings are currently cut down in this area.
It's better if we wake up early.

A way to create the Voice Command Definition (VCD.xml) for Cortana using C#.
Currently here: https://github.com/WilliamABradley/CortanaExtensions
It was inspired by NotificationExtensions, where you can create the Cortana VCD.xml using C# instead of figuring out how to define the XML yourself.
This can be really helpful if you want to easily create a Multi-Lingual Cortana Experience, if you use RESW.
As well as a RESW File Code Generator (Or RESX), and a tool like the MultiLingual Toolkit.

Sets is set to be the biggest change to Window and App UI, and so before it goes live, Microsoft needs to establish clear UI goals for making apps look like they belong and fit into these Tabs.
I have been exploring how you would go about making App layouts "work" within their Tab, and thought I would share and pass it on.
I am open to be convinced, but without a Top Bar of some kind, I don't think Apps can look good with Sets.

The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable, that it can't be used with any confidence in a product.
Problems I have encountered:
1) While using PositionChanged event Geolocator.ReportInterval seems to be ignored.
The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval, phones seem to ignore it completely e.g.
ReportInterval set to 1 second, the phone would regularly take 30 - 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to report.
As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy.
If the Phone doesn't have an accurate location, simply return what it does have.
2) GetPositionAsync() and GetGeopositionAsync(TimeSpan, TimeSpan) regularly never return.
Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to use these APIs instead, unfortunately they are also unreliable.
The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe 15 times in a row and then simply stop working and never return... despite having a timeout parameter!?
?
3) In general the API is poorly designed.
Changing properties on an active Gelocator causes exceptions.
Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers i.e.
the API is too implicit it works on side-effect rather than deliberate commands.

The Windows Store analytics API is great.
But a very important tab, Channels and Conversions, is missing.
Including the data from this tab in the Store analytics API would allow developers to integrate their custom marketing campaign performance into their campaign management, and would be extremely powerful for developers doing paid acquisition.
The most important data is the "Conversions breakdown by campaign ID" table at the bottom of the page.

In the Health page of Dev Center analytics, crashes and hangs can be filtered by OS version (RTM, 1507, 1511, 1607, etc.).
Please provide this same information on the 'Usage' page.
OS information is not included at all on the 'Usage' page.
While I get crashes by OS (Health page), I need to cross-reference this with usage by OS to determine the overall impact of a given bug.

If a contact has a phone number whose type is "company", then you have no way to access it in a 3rd-party app, because the Contact.PhoneNumbers does not contain it.

Once a flight group is selected for a package Flight Submission it cannot be changed.
Allowing it to change would help greatly in our release process.
Currently to perform our final Staging test we submit a package flight and add a group that targets our internal testers.
This works well.
Once we complete internal testing many time we want to open up the distribution to a larger group.
The group on the submitted flight cannot be changed without submitting a new flight which may require a rebuild since the same version cannot be submitted and waiting for another certification many time it is not just a couple hours and can be over night.
If we could change the group with out a resubmission this would allow us to transition from internal test to an external beta very easily.
Even better if multiple groups are allowed we could just add the external group and remove it as we like and still keep the internal group linked.
Less group management in the latter option of using multiple groups.

the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, up to 12 weeks from a selected day.
I hope you understand me.
I'm German and my English is not so good.
My problem is, I can use any calendar app, but the function goes back to the base calendar.
often I have to make dates that returns 4 weeks on Friday or two weeks on Wednesday.
In my old Android calendar is it no problem but in my wp8 is it not possible.

When uploading screenshots, we are given the choice to upload one of the these sizes: 768 x 1280, 720 x 1280, or 480 x 800 pixels
I would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in 1080x1920 pixel size.
Lumia 1520 takes screenshots in 1080x1920 size and having to resize 8 screenshots across multiple languages is not how a developer should spend time.
1080x1920 is the same aspect ratio as 720x1280 so it should be easily down scalable.

I would like to register a url with my application so that when someone clicks http://www.mydomain.com/ in the browser or is redirected to the browser from another application they are given the option to open my application instead of the browser.
With default options etc...
This would be good in Windows 8 too.

The current Windows Audio driver design only allows you to use 24 channels simulatenously.
There are many devices (like a USB-Madi, or Dante Virtual Soundcard) which use at least 64 channels.
These channels are not accessible with the current AudioGraph API's.
This is a real problem.
The Playback Devices and Recording Devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate, channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better UI.
It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications.
I really hope this will change in the near future because for Pro Audio applications, something really has to change.

Control.FontSize is of type double.
However, if I assign a double it appears to assign a float, as when I get the value of Control.FontSize it returns float-like values.
For example;
var tb = new TextBox();
tb.FontSize = 10.3d;
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Double - {tb.FontSize}");      //Double - 10.3000001907349
tb.FontSize = 10.3f;
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Float - {tb.FontSize}");       //Float - 10.3000001907349
I would expect assigning 10.3d to return 10.3.

The documentation for UserConsentVerifier says that it:
&gt; Checks for availability of a biometric (fingerprint) verifier device and performs a biometric verification.
However, if you have a PIN on your system, it treats that as a biometric device as well.
This is not what the documentation indicates.
UserConsentVerifier should not treat a PIN as a biometric device.
It might make sense to have another method alongside RequestVerificationAsync that allows consent verification via PIN or password, but there needs to be a way to request biometric-only consent verification.

Basically the equivalent of http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.emptydatatemplate.aspx but then for WinRT

I developed the app bizview, a Google Analytics client with the same features of Official Google Analytics app in the Android Store.
bizview rating is about 4.5 and has many reviews.
bizview is updated usually adding features.
The problem is: If I search "Google Analytics" in Windows 10 mobile Store the app is not in the first 5 results.
The previous 5 app are:
- old
- not updated
- with less reviews
- low rating
How bizview can not be first in all regions?
This question is not because bizview is my own app, the question is for all developers that works hard.

But if I'm designing an app just for a desktop, I should be able to get remote device info, remote registry read-write, copy-write files, etc remotely.
Basically I should be able to admin a remote desktop.

Windows Media Player can play .mid files for a very long time but Groove Music App cannot because WinRT does not have API to play MIDI file.

Seeing as SplitView is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area, it would make sense for SplitView to allow a PanePlacement.Top and PanePlacement.Bottom in addition to its current Left and Right parameters.
This change would allow Developer to be able to consider the usage of SplitView when targetting small WVGA/WXGA such as the Lumia 520/525/530 which have an extremely thin horizontal resolution compared to its available vertical space.
If this change was made, it would be easier to target a UI to low resolution/low end devices by being able to set the pane to top or bottom for the apps menu controls instead of having to rig together a solution of setting the visibility of an external control and turning off a bunch of settings on the pane when screen resolution gets narrow enough.

UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions.
This was found on a windows tablet but can be replicated on a windows PC by changing the scale in the display settings to 150%
In visual studio, if I select the container (a grid) and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical, the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that it's the render.

I believe that everyone in XAML lovers, we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.
These are widely used in the real world today.
In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes, visual programming, animation software, single/multitracks audio editors, video editors, slide editors, photo gallery, websites, social networks among many others.

It would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i.e I tell the user "you have x appointments today - Would you like to review them ?"
and then launch the calendar.

If it's MS Windows Phone then make it as a part of the network.
Will see all shared resources.
One shared folder can be set on phone device.
Easy to access and transfer on both sides PC-Phone.

With Composition Behaviors we have a very nice way to do animations using just setters, however if you want to change Visibility of a control after performing animation you have to add a storyboard to your visual state, otherwise it will be changed immediately.
Would be great if setter had "Delay" property to only execute it after a certain amount of time.

Please allow me to determine the Total Number of Apps Downloads, across all my Aps, from 3 to 4 years ago.
Not just 12 months.
The Mobile App used to be a lot better than this latest Web dashboard.

In the case where no bing maps data is being used (e.g.
a CustomMapTileDataSource with the bing maps layer disabled using MapStyle=None, MapTileSource Layer=BackgroundReplacement) you still get the "(C) Microsoft Corporation" watermark, which is now flat out wrong.
Ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly, plus some smart watermark (i.e.
if custom tiles are being displayed, get the watermark(s) associated with them).

In my enterprise application, basically a sales and purchase application.
Currently UWP allow RenderTargetBitmap API to render framework element in xaml to image which currently in viewed in screen.
But in my case, i want to print receipt and don't want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer.
But RenderTargetBitmap API doesn't work in Background.
Please allow that API in in background.

The design guidelines should be the law.
Don't allow ugly interfaces, be stricter on things like navigation, general look and feel, even animation.
Give developers good explanation what they do wrong, and enforce good design.
If something is unresponsive, it should not be allowed unless there is a clear and good reason for it.
Apps should take no longer than 2-3 seconds to start, and need to explain why they would take longer.
Make the marketplace of the highest quality out there!

Window should stay the size I left it.
It does not.

It would be very useful if you allow external devices (e.g through Bluetooth) to control the running audio/video on the phone.
This feature is implemented in the accessory API which is restricted to only smart watch makers.
An example would be i would want to have my smart watch pause or alter the volume

The DAC wim files are not keeping up with the Window 10 Preview Builds and as such I cannot use the DAC.

Not being able to compile shaders at runtime is a huge inconvenience, and prevents projects like ANGLE from producing a fully compliant OpenGL port.

Im using Windows 10 and VS2017.I have a Finguerprint sensor and Windows hello installed and working fine.
It detects finguers.
Im now developing a UWP app for multiuser registration using finguerprint.
For that propose Im using following part of code:
      var keyCreationResult = await KeyCredentialManager.RequestCreateAsync( ("Peter", KeyCredentialCreationOption.ReplaceExisting);
 The problem I found is that it currently shows a UI dialog asking for current loged in user credentials confirmation.
It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection( as is in the normal Windows 10 "Windows Hello" Settings page).
Afther loged in user confirmation the dialog closes and no forther finguerprint detection is possible.
I dont know is this is a Security norm from Microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection ?!
.
Please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working?
and how develop more library for correctly use multiuser finguerprint registration and detection.
thank you Jose Lopes

more color in diagrams ,older eyes need some digital help,color will prompt them to act.

The Action property is an int for some reason, but appears to just be a CollectionChange enum.
It should use the enum as its type instead of an unknown int value.

When a MessageDialog is already showing a second MessageDialog is created and shown, an UnauthorizedException is thrown.
There are legitimate reasons why this might happen.
A location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example.
Currently, there is no way for code to figure out if a dialog is already showing.
Further, there is no mechanism for queuing multiple MessageDialogs.
The only way to detect it is by looking for UnauthorizedException, but that exception is ambiguous.
And even then, what do you do?
Do you try to show the dialog over and over again on a timer?

Currently Windows OS decides the best Internet connection and uses it automatically (If I have more than one connection like WiFi and Network cable).
Need user setting option to override the same and assign one or more app to use specific network connection (WiFi) and others to use other possible network connection (3g/4g).
This way the already paid for (3g/4g, WiFi, Network cable, etc.)
or for that matter I can take more than one provider's internet with variable speeds at home and connect to one PC and use it optimally/efficiently.

Textboxes in Windows Phone built-in apps (for instance, in the message hub) allow the user to scroll just by swiping the finger on it.
The Silverlight textbox doesn't support this kind of scrolling, and forces the user to long tap on it until the caret appears, then move his finger to the sides of the textbox.
It's imprecise and frustrating, and confuses the user as he's not used to this behavior in system apps.
Providing the same scrolling in the Silverlight/WinRT textbox would definitely improve the user experience.

Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable should function correctly in UWP.
The documentation here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/77zkk0b6(v=vs.110).aspx indicates that it should work on Windows 10 / UWP.
Version Information
Universal Windows Platform
Available since 10
The documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an EnvironmentPermission for this to work, but out of the box running this code in a UWP project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you don't specify the EnvironmentPermission.
ExceptiontCondition
ArgumentNullExceptiont
variable is null.
SecurityExceptiont
The caller does not have the required permission to perform this operation.
The improvements should be along the lines of
1) Make sure that attempting to GetEnvironmentVariable throws applicable exceptions.
2) Make it possible to add the EnvironmentPermission node in the Package.appxmanifest to allow Environment variables to be retrieved.

At the moment, there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens.
If the list is alphabetic, there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter.
But sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter.
I donxe2x80x99t know what the component should look like.
Maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to use the scrollbar.

We need to display XML files, which references a stylesheet (XSL).
Therefore a local XSL Transformation has to take place to show files from e.g.
the LocalCache folder.
One way to do this is to use the XsltProcessor.
Currently, document() function is disabled.
Therefore it would be nice to have an option like XsltSettings.EnableDocumentFunction Property in .NET apps.

The new Windows 10 Apps (UAP) uses an .appxmanifest file which is in XML format.
It would be better if this file was in JSON format and followed the Manifest for web application standard from W3C: http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/
This would enable easier and potential reuse of manifest file across multiple platforms.

It seems VirtualLock API is not permitted from UWP apps.
For uwp apps that choose to do their own low level audio rendering / capturing for e.g.
using WASAPI, the app should be allowed to pin the memory buffer such that a page fault is not incurred in the real-time thread callback function.
I have not seen a issue so far just because my desktop system has enough memory.
But without the guarantee i feel a little uncomfortable.
In general any hard real-time app would require access to locked memory to avoid page faults unless UWP does not want to target such apps and MS advises to write classic Win32 apps for such use case.

It could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone.
Because it's a key control for mobile application also.
Auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application.
So it's better if you figure out any one of these to achieve the searching criteria in windows mobile application.

When you use the PhotoChooserTask and specify a PixelWidth and PixelHeight, when an image is chosen, the user is provided with a cropping tool that is outstanding and difficult to duplicate.
Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool.
Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included.
This would allow for Picture cropping.

It's not possible to bind to a custom attached property in a different namespace in code behind.
Binding in WPF the PropertyPath took the DependencyProperty itself as an argument, so you could do this.
In UWP, it only takes a string instead which will throw an exception if given a namespace.
It'd be great for the PropertyPath in UWP to also work the way WPF did and take the DependencyProperty to create the binding path from any source.


I'm creating app using face detection.
I want to add sticker to user's face match eyes nose mouth and ear.
Until now I can't find any api or documents about this.

Occasionally an update to an app gets past developer &amp; certification testing and is released into the wild.
Even if the bug is an easy fix for the developer it will take the certification team the standard 4+ days to certify the new build and publish it.
Instead of this we should be allowed to roll back to a previously published version without going through certification.
That way the users will be back on a stable release (or will not be prompted for an update if they were still on the previous release) and the developer will not feel rushed to get their fixed update into certification.

BingMapsDirectionsTask, Only set start point, when the task is running, it's prompt "Getting directions" , it's alert "End point not found, we couldn't find a match for your ending point."
I don't think this is a good design for BingMapsDirectionsTask, it's not flexible.
i cloud be only set the start point or not.

The name reservation field doesn't accept spaces.
Please fix, I am tired of writing names into Notepad and then pasting them...
Fix your key validation.

Distribute more application bar icons in SDK (at least each one used by built-in applications); provide forum/marketplace for other artwork, including control templates &amp; styles.

Add a Boolean to the CameraCaptureTask to optionally add the picture taken to the Camera Roll.

Allow their to be faster response times for contacting App Store after submitting feedback link found at the bottom of the certification report after having your app rejected.
 As its very inconvenient to have to wait for 5 business days to have a response, and you may need to have your app on the store in less time depending on an urgency which I have due to needing to have my app passed for one of my love ones who have passed away.

If phone is lost allow remotely setting custom message on the lock screen, i.e.
contact information.

Having access to the Visibility of the System Back button is good, but there are some scenario's where I think it would make sense to have a Disabled state for this button which could be toggled by Dev's in certain scenarios.
For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.
I know it is possible to block the handle of the BackRequested but I think the user should know when that button is disabled or not for consistency and user experience.

With the new Windows UI Library now in pre-release.
Are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the Toolbox alongside the OS based standard controls?
Will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page?
Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing, be working?
Will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources, without having to ask developers to copy and paste XAML files.
Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup, especially as the UI Toolkit iterates in the future.

In UWP, when a MenuFlyout control is placed within a CommandBar inside the Page.TopAppBar (or BottomAppBar), in Light theme the MenuFlyoutPresenter has the incorrect background color.
To recreate, paste the below XAML into a blank page and run (be sure the app is configured to use Dark theme).
The CommandBar in the Page body works as expected.
The CommandBar in the Page.TopAppBar has a dark MenuFlyoutPresenter Background brush.
A pseudo-fix is demonstrated with the third CommandBar in the BottomAppBar: if the CommandBar.RequestedTheme property is explicity set to Light, the MenuFlyoutPresenter will have a grayish background that isn't ideal but makes the text legible.
Example Page: (App1 should be configured to use Dark theme)

It's a pain to use the TimePicker control on desktop.
When selecting the minutes, you have to scroll through a huge list of 60 numbers...
Instead, you should be able to just type "45" to select 45!
I'm using the time picker in my app, Power Planner, and two users have complained about this (and I've complained about it myself).
This should be part of the built-in control!
It's quite terrible to use on desktop presently!

Currently in D2D for Windows Phone ID2D1Factory::CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget is strangely not supported.
I would like to have one to be able to do HQ  software rendering using Direct2D.

Currently, it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel.
In WPF we could inherit the base classes to re-use the existing base functionality.
But in UWP it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors, and the other classes are sealed.
A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization, because it is so hard to implement in UWP.
This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections.
Please open up the base classes for inheritance, and provide a sample how to create a custom virtualizing panel.

Would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running?
E.g.
the back button.
Template 10 has a Loading (Busy) page that has this functionality.

Right now the APIs only allow recognition of text input.
I know Microsoft already has the digital ink recognition technology for math formulas.
It's even available in WPF via Math Input Control.
I think it shouldn't be too hard to make it available in UWP as well.
But either way please do make an API available.
Thanks!

I would like to use data-binding with Razor syntax similar to what  ASP.Net MVC has.
The binding syntax should support Intellisense.
When binding class is optionally specified, the compiler should do static type-checking and produce build errors when binding is invalid.

There are design toolkits available for several designer programs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/downloads/index.
However, there is no toolkit available for Affinity Designer (which is the only design program besides Adobe XD that is available in the Microsoft Store).
Please make the (Fluent) design toolkits available for Affinity Designer.

Please allow generic classes to be base classes of XAML pages/controls.
This would improve the developer experience when using libraries such as MVVMCross

We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted.
The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it (same filename) the create date stays the same!
Here is a small c# sample to prove it.
How to reproduce.
Run the code.
It creates a test.log file.
Check the Create date on the file.
Example: 2018-02-07 16:05
Run the code again.
It deletes the file.
Wait one minute (so the clock shows a new minute) and the run the code again.
The test.log file is created again.
Check the create on the test.log, it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code!
Example: 2018-02-07 16:05.
It should have been 2018-02-07 16:06 (or later)
Run this as many times as you like, the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code.
If you go into the Explorer and delete the file and create it (in explorer) with the same name the create date is correct!

I've got a Win8 app in the store.
I want to beta test a win10 version of it.
So I set the app to "Hide &amp; Stop selling"
I then submit the win10 version and get some promo codes
Watching my app analytics, I see *FAR* more devices now have my win10 app than I intended, because *updates* still get pushed regardless of the listing settings!
This needs to be fixed.

The "{x:Static NumericConstant}" way of accessing code page constants in XAML page already exists in WPF.
This approach will provide an elegant way of accessing constants both in code and XAML pages in Silverlight, and for my immediate need in Windows Phone 7.
For instance,
public partial class App : Application
  public const int ImageHeight= 173;
in App.xaml.cs
and accessing the constant ImageHeight in a XAML page as:
&lt;Image Height="{x:Static App.ImageHeight}" ...
is a neater way of coding as compared to alternative approaches.
Please please incorporate this in future release.

The verification of Windows App Store failed with one of this message: "Image file snalllogo.png is a default image"
I think it is good to explain what is "default image".

Let us open up the phone application (here the the user can see callhistory++).
Also let us open the call-history page
Both are usefull for smart-dialing apps.
An app can at least have a button directly to call history so user can see call history (since a direct API for call-history is not given due to security reasons).
And a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the built-in phone app, since the app also can have a quick-button for "goto the regular phone app" whenever the user wants to do that.

The WebView control doesn't allow printing, embedded PDFs etc.
Please make the control usable in an app.
If it works in Edge, Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control.
Not sure why even having a web browser control if it isn't going to have full browser features (minus the tabs, settings, URL input box etc.
).
Since Edge doesn't support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this.

the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened in it.
The last five should be frozen and any more than that should have to restarted.
To close an app the user should be able to use her/his finger to flick it upwards WebOS style.
in addition, the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen, a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder

The main impediments when creating a Chat-like control using a ListView is that we don't have a native way to handle incrementalLoading at the top of list.
There is already an example we can reuse in UWP samples https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlBottomUpList
We already have the PullToRefreshListView in the toolkit, so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like ListViewEx and have both of the functionality in a single control.

Up until now I have always added a GroupName to RadioButton controls as a hard-coded string in XAML.
However, I recently discovered that this GroupName seems to apply to the entire window, hence it can't be used inside user controls which are designed to be used more than once.
I then realised that specifying a GroupName is not necessary if the radio buttons are siblings within a container.
However, in this case specifying IsChecked="True" in XAML does not work if you have more than one set of radio buttons within a page (inside separate containers) - it seems like all sets of radio buttons within a page are treated as being part of the same group until some point in the loading cycle which occurs somewhere between InitializeComponent and Loaded, so only one radio button on the whole page will end up being checked.
Even if I tried to set the IsChecked property via x:Bind, I found that the above issue still applied in some cases.
In this case, I found a work-around by specifying the GroupName as a one-time x:Bind to a string created from a new Guid.
However this workaround doesn't work in the previous case as I'm guessing the binding is done too late.
Therefore to get the first case working I had to add a Loaded handler to the page or UserControl and manually set the initial radio button checked state in there.
All this just to set the initial state of a RadioButton!
Can you please look into fixing this?
I'm running Windows 10 version 1809 with the corresponding SDK.

adding stacks on desktop folders

I belive it's critical to make the minimize, maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined UI.
Suppose we have an app with two modes like Zune - normal and mini.
In the mini mode, the app only presents the indispensable and small elements on the window.
 For the mini mode, the three buttons in standard size are too big.
And for the consistency of the UI design, sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttons,especially the close button.
I know maybe it's not at the Microsoft's priority list, but I believe we can somehow make it available.
 For example, developers can hide those built-in buttons and draw their own ones and call "CoreWindow.Minimize()", "CoreWindow.Maximize" etc.
Or maybe just styling them as XAML elements though for now they are not XAML frameelements.
But that would be nice.
We do like to build universal Windows apps.
But for now, uwp obviously lacks some important features.
Looking forward to customizable window chrome for UWP apps.

Now on Windows Phone 8 when we have 3 resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time.
You have to run one emulator, take screenshots, close it and run another and so on.
We can scale wxga to wvga(it still requires some work), because they have the same ratio, but we can't do this with 720p.
Emulators are even slower than the WP7.1 ones, so the process is really long.
Consider also option where you have application in several languages.
You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on.
It takes a lot of time.
I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool(option in emulator) with which we can take screenshots once, in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app.
It would save us a lot of time.

It should be possible to deploy a UWP app inside the Edge browser as opposed to the App Store.
In browser apps will need to be sand boxed without elevated trust permissions
In-browser deployment was an excellent feature of Silverlight.
While most organizations will allow in-store apps, it's still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons.
Firstly, deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc.
from Microsoft when the app users won't even be the general public.
This burns Microsoft time as well as developer time.
Secondly, we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers.
This is going to be a nightmare to maintain in the app store.
In Silverlight, it's maintained merely with different Urls.
Thirdly, in-store apps are going to create all kinds of nightmares for us in dealing with IT departments that want to lock down app store usage.

Please support ODBC for UWP

please make windows app deployment tool like ADB for android cross platform so that we can access device from all plateform

there should be a function to costumise the tile depending on mood

As a developer, I am constantly dropping new packages into the Dev Dashboard.
When dropping appx bundles onto the drop target, the page takes a long time to respond.
Because the page doesn't change to reflect the drop operation was successful, I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target, wasting my time and bandwidth.
Bonus: The cancel button on the upload operation doesn't appear to function either.

The following example doesn't show an error in the Designer, but throws errors in the generated code.
If I add a (x:Int32) case before the inner function I get a 'Functions cannot have other functions as parameters' error.
Width="{x:Bind exf:Bind.Clamp(exf:Bind.Subtract(ContentHolder.
(ex:FrameworkElementExtensions.ActualWidth), 30), 100, 300)}"
It'd be great if we could chain functions together in x:Bind to create more complex expressions.
The above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element, but clamp it within a specific range.
Rather than writing a specific function for this purpose, it'd be nice if it could be composed of individual pieces that can be combined in many more ways.

Consider a full screen application where you'd like to temporarily control that brightness.
1) Camera app using display as a flash to light-up when using front facing camera.
2) Clock app to control the brightness of display at night time
3) Night mode in news app Mailonline app to provide a better reading experience in the evenings / nights.
A previous uservoice "API to control screen brightness" https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2359006-api-to-control-screen-brightness was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced.
BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT / Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API.
Please extend the API to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode.

The GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime() Win32 API is only available from Windows 8 onwards.
Testing shows that to be the case, and MSDN confirms it.
Therefore the function signature should have been guarded by a #if _WIN32_WINNT &gt;= _WIN32_WINNT_WIN8.
Sadly, that is not the case.
A call to the method with _WIN32_WINNT set to _WIN32_WINNT_WIN7 compiles just fine, and then miserably crashes with a "entry point could not be located" error on Windows 7.

Super glad you guys added this event to the UWP controls.
It is the only way I have found to grab keyboard events before a control does something I don't want in my app.
I do wish it was more reliable though.
Events don't always route up to the root control (in my case a Page) as one might expect with an event that uses the "Tunneling Routing Strategy" as described in the docs.
In particular I've found if a Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ScrollViewer has focus then the PreviewKeyDownEvent on the root Page control never gets fired.
The PreviewKeyDownEvent is still useful for stopping controls from doing their keydown behavior, it's just not great for doing anything additional without also adding a Window.Current.CoreWindow.KeyDown event handler to catch events that don't get caught in the PreviewKeyDown event.
It's definitely useful, but it would be amazing if it always worked!

It would be great to be able to get the current appointment and the next appointment a user has.
For example, I would like to display the user's next appointment like the one in the lock screen

The reason why Button needs a "Header" Attribute is because if I make a grid of a TextBox with Header Field set, and a place a button next to it... it looks likes like **** without the header padding to push the button down.
Here's an example:
&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition Height="*"/&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition Height="auto"/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;TextBox Header="Site Information" Grid.Column="0"/&gt;
    &lt;Button
        Header=""  &lt;!-- THIS IS THE FIX NEEDED.
TRY WITHOUT.
--&gt;
        Content="Do-Something-Special-Button"
        Grid.Column="1"
        Margin="4,0" /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
Without a "Header" Attribute for the Button Control... it looks like ****... and doesn't line up....
Another possiblity is to add an Attribute to Button called:
"HeaderLeaveRoom=true"
That would be sort of like going to Starbucks and telling the casher person to  "leaving room for Cream in your Coffee"... where the cream layer is for your Headers....

ListView mishandles NotifyCollectionChangedAction is several ways.
1.
It causes the ListView to scroll to the top which was unexpected and therefore frustrating to diagnose.
2.
There's no associated animation.
Mapping it to an add/remove would be acceptable, but a specific animation for move would also be nice.

I believe that everyone in XAML lovers, we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.
These are widely used in the real world today.
In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes, visual programming, animation software, single/multitracks audio editors, video editors, slide editors, photo gallery, websites, social networks among many others.
# NetworkView Control
A control for visualizing and editing networks, graphs and flow-charts
&lt;NetworkView&gt;

Apple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016.
We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesn't support playing these type of streams.
This will also impede our ability to reuse these fMP4s for MPEG DASH in the future.
Can you please add support for this?


Let users add their own Checkboxes, Comboboxes, etc to the FileSavePicker UI.
Example: https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/227482.image0.jpg

I did a report on in app purchases today and noticed that every line item shows an app version of 1.0.0 - which most certainly is not the case.

by benchmarking a developer a good developer work.
it will encourage a developer to design better apps and it makes very easy for customers to choose the right apps ibstead of selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time..

The Clipboard content for example a file copied in the Clipbord get lost if the the App is closed but it should be persistent.

Please add background to TextBlock control.
I would like to have like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9op91.png
Instead of this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hjvme.png.

There is no option for hard and soft reset

When assigning app licenses in the Windows Store for Business (WSfB) end-users always get notified.
As this can become very annoying I'm missing the option/ability to disable end-user notification when new apps has been assigned.

At this moment the Launcher when launchs an URI it only supports http uris, it will be interesting that supports file:/// uris to send the launcher to open PDFs, words, and any file with just the URI, we do not need the StorageFile.
And in a BackgroundTask, the Launcher just does not launch websites, it is interesting to launch websites and reports in the computer in the morning saving time.

Included in the previous windows phone store description - was a 'last updated' field which would clearly let you know what the latest upload was.
Maybe add this to Additional Information.
Also the 'more from' publisher was an easy way for the developer to promote one's other published apps.
It was also nice to see your 'badges' of honor... in one place {:
Another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom - showing related apps - as long as they meet a certain review standard - to promote cross visibility.

There are a lot of "ms-settings:***" commands to launch different settings pages from code on HoloLens, but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings.
A command like "ms-settings:utilities" would be very useful.

We live in a multi-touch world, we have hardware that supports 10 points of touch and yet, in windows phone, once a standard control has focus the other controls will not be enabled to touch commands from different fingers.
It is not a "natural" behavior and in some scenarios it would make phone applications act strange to [new] users.
Windows 8, iOS, Android already support true multi-touch .
Scenarios where multi-touch is needed:
- Big device like 1520 and the user holds it with one hand but touches the screen on one side.
When using the application none of the controls will work as they won't have focus
-Give the device to a kid with a simple app/game (not developed in Unity) and for him it would be natural to keep both hands on the device and the app will become unusable
Just inherit the management from Windows 8.
In my opinion it is essential to have true multi-touch support for standard controls at least in Universal Applications.

Hi!
I use IMFSourceReader on UWP and noticed following bug with FLAC decoding: it will not change position if SetCurrentPosition will be called right after initialization.
It is working correct with .mp3 and other codecs, but not with FLAC.

However, if you set it to true, the SemanticZoom doesn't hook to the BackRequested event.
This violates developer expectations.
Since the SemanticZoom is subscribed to the BackRequested event, if I navigate to another page and press the back button, the BackRequested event is not called on my navigated page, since it is handled by the SemanticZoom in the previous page, even if page caching is disabled for the Frame.
The SemanticZoom is kept alive because it is referenced by the SystemNavigationManager.

It would be great if the Windows Phone development team could allow us to use the RSTP streaming protocol in .NET Compact Framework we use.
For my idea (which is a big secret !
), I need this protocol implementation, I certainly can't deal with any other protocol (weather best or worst).
What do you think about it ?
Wouldn't be a good idea ?
(implementing new things for us is always a good thing in my opinion !)
(sorry if my English is bad, that's a foreign language for me, I'm French)

Windows Phone 8.1 SDK brought a lot of built in transitions, making easier to develop a native-like app.
But I'm missing that list animations seen on Settings or Messaging apps when opening or closing them.
There are properties like IsStaggeringEnabled and IsStaggerElement in the CommonNavigationInfo class, but the animations doesn't feel like the native one.
Thanks and keep up the good work with Windows Phone!

We need a beta store for windows 10 apps for selected internal testers only.
With the windows phone store it was possible to have a beta version of the app.With windows apps, it was not (and nobody ever got why!
).
Copy from Android and add beta and alpha store too!
Do not complain if developers prefer other platforms: you don't make us life easy at all!!
!

Add 2 more properties for gridviews controls.
- Boolean AdaptItemHeight
- Integer MaxNumberOfColumns
With AdaptItemHeight set to true the height of the gridviewitems can be variable.
The item will adapt its height to the content.
With MaxNumberOfColums you can limit the number of columns.
This property is especially usefull when AdaptItemHeight is set to true.

Orbit View Currently have 2D plane so for Mixed Reality Apps third Dimension needed to expand it functionality.
Like for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites, NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in 3D make it better in Mixed reality

I would like to create my own Windows Wheel implementation for an existing bluetooth device that sends events over the BLE GATT protocol (not HID).
I know it is possible to use something like https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/HIDInjector, but having to write c++ code for Bluetooth is holding me back.
I would much rather write some UWP-like background application in C# that injects RadialController events.

It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than 100KB, (1 MB at least), this would prevent us from having to depend on a network/paid service to have great cross-device customer experiences.

The touchmove event is called only once, when I move my finger across the screen.
So I can't create complex HTML pages with a fixed header and a scrollable content.
I will move the content per javascript but I can not because the touchmove event is not triggered.
Please implement the whole TouchApi in the Internet Explorer and the WebBrowser Control.
This is VERY IMPORTANT for mobile websites because iPhone and Android support this.
Please Help!
Thanks.

Photo chooser  should also allow us to customize the photo chooser task like the one in Photos Hub.
The photo chooser task needs to support selecting multiple pictures feature, and add an app bar to it.

We miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls "page by page" by using flick gestures.

It would be nice it there was an API Discovery endpoint.
for example: &lt;deviceIpAddress&gt;/api/me

The MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats.
But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource, it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams, because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.
So audio and video works, but subtitles don't work.
Since subtitles are demuxed on-the-fly during playback, we cannot use TimedTextSource either, this would require the complete stream/file to be available during creation...
This would be very helpful to make the MS initiated FFmpegInterop truly unviersally useful.

Ubuntu linux etc etc fusion

Created a custom attached property for Page elements.
Added PropertyMetadata via PropertyMetadata.Create so I could specify a CreateDefaultValueCallback handler.
When using the custom attached property, my CreateDefaultValueCallback handler gets called over and over again, it doesn't appear to ever set the value of the attached property.
I can have two lines of code, one right after the other that are both calling Get(PropertyName) on the same object/property, and each time my default value callback is executed.
I would expect that the default value callback only gets called once, then sets the value for that object/property.

If a control is hidden in the UI (inside a parent control with Visibility=Collapsed) bindings will not be set.
At first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible.
However, if you make the parent visible, binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.
This was probably done as a performance optimization; however, binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI.
Otherwise, yet again, MVVM is broken.

(It's does with Html, but not with Text.)
This is contrary to the docs, and to expected behavior.
Sometimes we need this even with text.

I submitted my word game to the apple App Store.
In 2 days it was downloaded 600 times.
I submitted the same app to the windows phone store.
It has been live for a week now and has received a total of only 17 downloads.
Daily downloads has dropped down to between 0 and 1.
I have been a developer for the windows phone since it first debated.
When the windows phone marketplace was young, you used to receive a nice visibility boost when your app was new - which translated to at least hundreds of downloads.
Now a new app is nearly invisible.
I suggest you fix this problem or else you will no longer have developers interested in your platform.

Allow us to withdrawal the money because we don't know when we can reach the threshold USD 200.

Developers need to be able to use their MS account to sign into the VS2012 phone emulator.
If it is a real account I do not see the problem here?
We need to be able to test our applications with other windows apps installed.
Even if they are only the free apps.
Why is this disabled?
What is the issue here?


I developed an app that plays public HTTP live streams.
It worked fine and I used it long time till mid May 2018, when many of HLS streams wouldn't play stable.
It plays from few seconds to several minutes than starts hiccuping then finally stops.
It reproduces for these streams all the time on Windows Phone 10, as well as Windows Phone Emulator as well as Windows 10 Desktop, all build 14393.
The "good" streams continue playing smoothly on all those devices.
The "bad" streams play smoothly on fresh versions of Windows Phone (Lumia 950 XL, build 15xxx), and Windows Desktop.
An example of good stream: http://hls-02-europaplus.emgsound.ru/11/playlist.m3u8
An example of bad stream: http://hls-01-europaplus-top40.emgsound.ru/21/playlist.m3u8
I'm desperate to find a solution, since Microsoft wouldn't update most of Windows Phones past 14393.

Provide access to Playlist API to be able to create (auto) playlists based on the song library on the phone.

Why you donxd1x8dt investigate MP and don't take the idea of xe2x80x8bxe2x80x8bhow to cut the programmers work.
Why complicate the work so that the majority of the time spent on it to get around the restrictions?

When setting "ToolTipService.Placement" to "Mouse", the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.
It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels, but rather half a pixel off vertically.
This is on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 16299.19) @ 150% DPI scale, the app targets Windows 10 SDK 16299.
See an example image here: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjrUg-ZuIcYZt8wLuah3CjvJgfDiJA

When creating a login page, I found that when placing the focus in the user name field, the header and textbox added an additional box around the field to indicate focus.
However; on the password box, the field focus does not occur.
I think this needs to be consistent behavior.

Please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby NFC tag is recognized.
The current options have the current drawbacks for me:
- To react on a NFC tag my app currently has to start which can be time-consuming and could interupt the user in his current task on another app
- The NFC tag is currently only recognized when the phone or lock screen is active.
It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.

Not all the world is writing APP for the store, rather i think that MS developer are manly involved in enterprise solutions, so UWP need at minimum something like a RELAXED PROGRAMMING MODEL for trusted  in house, enterprise software.
In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric.
We are spending (and loosing) a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things (like pass command line arguments.., write on folders .., trying to execute another program ..).

some time we need playing two MP3 in the same time.

When using classic Win32 MessageBox() API, the spawned dialog allows you to copy its content (using Ctrl+C).
The equivalent WinRT API - MessageDialog - provides no apparent means to copy the message to clipboard - no response to right click, no response to Ctrl+C.
Sample code:
            using namespace Windows::UI::Popups;
            MessageDialog^ dlg = ref new MessageDialog("somemessage");
            dlg-&gt;Title = "sometitle"
            dlg-&gt;ShowAsync();
Thanks for your attention.

I have an app in the store to make a live tile clock.
It worked fairly well on WP8.1, but now on W10M, when you go to the start screen, until the tile notification refreshes, the live tile shows the default app tile.
I checked with multiple clock tile apps in the store and they all have this same fundamental issue.
(blank or app logo on tile until tile notification refreshes).
What would be nice is, instead of sending tile notifications for every minute, if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute.
Something like what HTC shipped with their Windows Phones.
In an effort to minimize overhead, may the system settings could allow for only one selected clock app to be running?

I think there are two ways to improve the beta program:
1.
Make apps available immediately.
When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be "approved".
We upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately.
2.
If immediate approval is not possible, then apps that have been published should be immediately available.
When we receive emails saying the beta application is published, users are not able to download the application with the very own links provided in the email.
Users are reporting a 1-2 day time between when the app is approved to when it is available for download.
Users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application.

I'd like to add ItemClick event to the Carousel control to be able to use it as Item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the GridView and ListView.

I have been building computers and my first was a dos and i played game'son it.
and now that i am in my 50's Iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate.
and we can say its windows for Mom and dad.

Provide more help with understand text that coming from cortanan.
things i think about is like understanding dates and times.

Today I opened the Windows Dev account Payout report , I found up my advertising and my purchased app, already separate into two?
Why this happen?
I should get the total payout summary which include advertising and app that had purchased,

Enabling a custom provider in the "Realtime ETW tracing" page of Windows Device Portal shows no details other than the timestamp for each event.
I've been using PerfView and that works great and shows the event details (payload, keywords, level, etc.
), so the events are being logged OK.
I was just hoping to use the portal for realtime monitoring, but it doesn't appear to be working correctly.
Note the events from my provider are not using a manifest, just the Win32 "::EventWriteString" API.
Not sure if this has any relevance.

there should be mechanism that code can read installed apps.

In BluetoothLEDevice class you can return the current RawSignalStrengthInDBm(RSSI) of the connected device.
I know it is present at the time of BluetoothLEAdvertisement But, could not get the RSSI value while sending and receiving data on GattDeviceService connection.
Otherwise at least provide a way or some filter to get RSSI value.

It does not have any sense to be forced to compile C#/.NET for all targets prior to uploading package to Windows Store.
I would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures.
What if Microsoft adds ARM64 target tomorrow?
Or MIPS?
It also annoys during development, because now my solution has to have 4 target platforms, while it could just have one.

In Windows Store apps there is no way to programmatically initiate a print job.
Under WPF, it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling Print() on a properly configured PrintDocument object.
We have a popular photo booth app in the Windows Store.
It is able to provide a fully automated photo booth experience for the user's event guests EXCEPT when it comes to printing.
In order to print, the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog.
If it were running under WPF, then it would simply print the user's photo when done.
But if it were under WPF, then we wouldn't have the great full-screen touch experience of the Modern UI.
Could you please add programmiatic printing to the WinRT API?

Provide Process Class/APIs (like that for regular Windows) to develop lower level operations like Task Manager in Windows

There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.
1.
If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.
This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.
2.
The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer, select properties and see check box at the bottom), which used to be recommended for SSD drives.
In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.
It also happens if the indexer isn't working properly (which is not uncommon).
3.
If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon), then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).
Ideally if the properties are not indexed, then GetPropertiesAsync should still work but fall back to using non-indexed methods.
I believe that it's possible to specify options regarding the indexer on some queries but not the neighboring files one.
I don't think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.
Obviously I would expect in point 3 that neighboring files should still be available (but maybe slightly slower).
In my opinion, this is a bug although I guess maybe it counts as a design limitation or feature suggestion.
Would be great if it could be addressed.

I know that text boxes can be customized easily.
But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input.
I'm currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.
That's why I'm suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers.
I'm suggesting a textbox with the following feature:
1.
Only allows numeric input
2.
Allow entering negative values
3.
Allow entering decimal values
4.
Format the text with a specific number of decimal place (i.e.
1.456 -&gt; 1.46)
5.
Format numbers with commas on thousands (i.e.
1,000,000.00) on mouse leave and remove commas when editing.
6.
Allow specifying the Min and Max value.
If the user enters a value less than the min value, the value will be updated to min value on lost focus.

Currently a Bluetooth LE device that advertises with a 7 second pinging interval won't automatically reconnect to a windows phone, 6 seconds seems to be the magic number (this is from a background task trying to reconnect after a link loss, e.g.
in the keep the keys example).
Please extend this to be the Maximum time that the Bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection (which is 32 seconds), or atleast make it greater than 6 seconds so that very low power Bluetooth devices can be made.
The phone can manually initiate a connection with greater values, but the background task won't automatically reconnect.

Several members of returned JSON from Twitter's API are missing from the Services.Twitter implementation.
This returns the full URL of a t.co shortened URL in a tweet:
entities &gt; urls &gt; unwound &gt; url
The title of the URL as displayed in the URL card on the tweet:
entities &gt; urls &gt; unwound &gt; title
For quote tweets, a parameter named quoted_status returns information about a quoted tweet.
Info came from here:

We need support special multitasking tasks, like VOIP and IM!
We can't create good apps for this services without this API, looks on your Skype client, wtf??
iOS already has this API's!

Why we can't share the Certification Report generated if our apps is failed in the submission?
We need it :)

I'm using the OnlineIdAuthenticator instead of the LiveSDK because it's API references that I would be able to always show a UI to prompt the user to enter their credentials by setting the "CredentialPromptType" to "RetypeCredentials".
However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on "Save", which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned.
Because this is SSO for phone, the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly.
If I enter the *wrong* password, then the UI for the credentials prompt does not leave the prompt screen (because the password was not valid).
This seems to be a serious security flaw with the API if it is allowing blank passwords to proceed as valid (while wrong passwords are treated as invalid).

Settings configuration

Currently when you overpan a ScrollViewer, where's no way to tell how much negative offset it is unless you do hacks like calculating it every 50ms via a Timer.
This will make interesting actions like 'Pull to Refresh' very hard to implement.
Would be nice to have an event to listen to this with a OverpanOffset property or something.


Microsoft finally developed a library able to handle NFC devices.
Unfortunately the library is only able to get the NDEF messages and doesn't give the UID of the card!
Is there a reason why this UID is not saved in the Proximity-Device once the NFC card is read?

Although it is possible to define custom ETW events, and to generate those events, the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events.
The Windows Phone Developer Power Tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events.
There appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources.
So although in, e.g., .NET-based store apps, the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events, there doesn't appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can't actually record those events in a trace!
Just to be clear, this is *not* a duplicate of http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3743880-please-provide-etw-logging-from-a-windows-phone-8 - as a reply in that thread points out, you can already log ETW events from a WP8 app.
What I want is the ability to record those alongside system-provided ETW events, so that I can see how my code's activity fits in with system behaviour.

Provide libraries to help me get started with Project Rome and building a cross-device experience for my application

As discussed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qTD5g14ks with Nikola Metulev the UX of a UWP app running on a multi-user / multi-touch device, to empower the possibility of the device itself shall be designed the way that several user can interact with the device at the same time.
The scatter-view idea is just the concept already applied to surface v1 and v2 tables to uwp.
With the upcoming Surface Hub 2s, 2x and the windows 10 collaborative displays coming i believe is time for the ScatterView to be merged into the Windows Community Toolkit.
Please upvote if you see the need of such control

I think the new dev center is a great step.
What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app.
That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language.
I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator.
I understand that having a translation is important but I am not a linguist (I honestly think I learned programming before proper grammar), I am a individual person making apps on my own and spending almost a whole day just to post the app descriptions is a big pain.
(maybe have a button next to each field where it would take the text from the primary description page.
and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example) For my app I have it in about 36 language/Country descriptions which is a big task to handle.
The user could then review the translations, as best as they could.
And if Microsoft couldn't translate it, it could just copy over the original text.

There is SystemTriggerType PowerStateChange, but it is not triggered when percent is changed.
So one of two options would be useful:
- adding new SystemTriggerType - BatteryPercentChange
- triggering PowerStateChange also on percent change
It would be useful for creating more user-friendly battery related apps that provide better experience, for example, by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event, not some time after it happened.

ApplicationView.SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while, and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead.
However, there's an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching.
With SuppressSystemOverlays, you can still force the status bar to show using StatusBar.ShowAsync.
When you use full screen mode, StatusBar.ShowAsync doesn't work.
To give you some context why this matters to us, our app is a video streaming app with both VoD and live TV content.
When the user starts video playback on a phone, we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar (on devices such as Lumia 950 that has them) and status bar.
But we turn the status bar back to visible, along with other playback controls, when the user taps the screen.
The information in the status bar is highly relevant to a video app.
Signal strength directly impacts video playback experience.
And the current time is convenient to see when checking the electronic program guide to see what's on now.
Sure, we could replace the status bar with our own UI containing the same info.
But reusing the operating system component saves us development effort and ensures it looks as expected as the operating system evolves.
So please, before you completely remove SuppressSystemOverlays, make sure there's a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode.


Today we have the x:DefaultBindMode attribute to define the default binding mode generated for a compiled data binding created with x:Bind.
We can set that mode on an element or on a parent element.
It would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the App-object in the App.xaml-file, and to make this the "ultimate root".
This would allow me to specify an application wide default binding mode, and I could set it in this single place for example to OneWay.

Extend page have a mistake that is the package manifest changes must be in the packaging project, not the UWP project

I'm a developer trying to make a Discord app for Windows Phone, Windows Tablet, Xbox and HoloLens.
It is a significant limitation to not have an opus supported library and makes many features impossible.

As a developer, I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
When I'm done using a Customer Group, I cannot delete or hide it.
(I also created a few test groups I can't delete in the past as part of my exploration of the dashboard.)
Unused groups eat up screen estate and impact load time of the page.

For some languages - Chinese for example - ink recognition results tend to have lots of errors.
It would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary/word list/constraint as we can already with Speech recognition, as it was possible in the old Microsoft.Ink API:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms829122.aspx
Really should be a must-have; I am working on an app that has expected writing entries and it is a pain when none of the recognition results are close.
And it is necessary for any app that needs to detect a custom word.
Here is a related StackOverflow question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36407922/how-to-add-a-custom-word-list-to-inkrecognizer-in-uwp

In the .appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value.
There should be an option to enter "accent" to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color.

Cortana for Windows IoT core only supports English.
Please bring all languages to Cortana for IoT because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world.
I thinks it's not difficult to do since Cortana for PC supports up to 13 languages, as listed on https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/557b5e0e-0eb0-44db-87d6-5e5db6f9c5b0/cortana-s-regions-and-languages

When looking at help &amp; examples online while working on my code, I sometimes run into differences between WPF, Windows Runtime, and Silverlight but don't realize it right away, and end up frustrating myself until I do.
I see no reason to have 3 variations that are so similar, especially with the current efforts to make things universal.
I think having 3 variations (did I forget any?)
does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration, and in the case of some people (although hopefully not many, and definitely not me), a reason to leave .NET.
If all 3 variations could be merged, I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future.

A developer should have the possibility to write his own complete implementation of background audio player or the built-in one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio title/album without pausing playback.

You can only select text as big as screen.
If larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text.

I have the following entry:
t&lt;Barcode&gt;
tt&lt;Symbology&gt;AZTEC&lt;/Symbology&gt;
tt&lt;Value&gt;M1STURM/ANDREAS       EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C&amp;gt;5080      B2A                                         N00  &lt;/Value&gt;
t&lt;/Barcode&gt;
there you can see the &amp;gt; which is correct XML/HTML encoded version of "&gt;".
However when the Barcode is generated, it will generate this code as image:
M1STURM/ANDREAS       EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C.Taacgpbwnxf +ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooov!xefxbfxbd
As you can see, it fails at the position where the "&gt;" should be.
I decoded it using http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx
When I encode "M1STURM/ANDREAS       EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C&gt;5080      B2A                                         N00  "
using http://www.java4less.com/barcodes/AztecCode/php/demo.php
I can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode correctly.
This Bug exists in WP 8.1 and 10.

SecureString exists on WP but not on winrt.

The Emulator should support SensorSDK

Currently, there is no way of knowing if a user converts from our own advertising campaign or "out of the blue".
It would be great if we could link to an app's store page with a campaign code, and get the breakdown by campaign codes in our daily stats.
For example:
United States       Paid (after trial)                                32
United States       Paid (after trial, campaign XYZ)       64
United States       Paid (without trial)                           16
United States       Paid (without trial, campaign XYZ)  48
United States       Trial                                                 192
United States       Trial (campaign XYZ)                       284

Please add vorlon.js to Device Portal

Pubcenter Ads should not play sound unless clicked on or have a way to mute ad sounds.
Users can't hear content in apps when video ads play automatically and this is extremely distracting to the user to the point where it can make the app unusable.

It would be very nice to be able to download the entire Windows Phone Tools and install it, instead of having to use the web for installation.
I am a teacher and having to install it this way for the entire lab takes forever.

HTTP stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone, that could be use for hosting webpage, downloading files from phone via browser etc

Mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an in-store app from a side loaded version that's in development.

Possibility to list usb devices connected to the phone, and interact with the connect devices.
Works on Android, connect a USB hub and a lot of usb gadgets (with no driver support) and open a socket/connection to the device to use it.
Use it a lot with IoT gadgets and android, would love to change the android device to a windows phone device and use c#.

Right now, you can start apps by holding down the Windows button and saying "start appname".
It would be great if you could start an app while adding some instructions, for example:
"Facebook, show me messages"
"Office, create new Word document"
"Prime TV, mark House Season 1 Episode 4 as watched"

Please review your Package scanning portion of the application.
It scanned my entire computer for certification (way outside the scope of building a UWP application).
It took an hour just to get through my STEAM library.

Supporting Windows Authentication could be very usefull for example writing app that interacts with Microsoft Dynamics CRM

Calling BitmapDecoder.Properties.GetPropertiesAsync (with any argument) cases the app window to hang indefinitely if the image the decoder is decoding is a webp or hiec image.
Support for these has been added in Windows version 1809, which I am using and I'm also using the corresponding SDK version.
Interestingly, the lower level WIC APIs are fine, and also the BitmapEncoder can set properties fine.
Please can this bug be fixed?

it wont let me cconnect it just sais turn on

DesktopAppConverter.ps1 : DesktopAppConverter : error  'E_CREATING_ISOLATED_ENV_FAILED':
Environment: Windows 10 Pro Version 1603 Build 15063.877
BaseImage: Windows_InsiderPreview_DAC_15063_1.wim
So I uninstalled KB4057144, became build 15063.850.
Re-try desktop app converter was successes.
I think that it is the problem of baseimage and KB4057144.
Of course, Version 1709 build 16299.214 can use the DAC.

it is slightly fustrating when one or two screenshots take longer to load and you cannot skip them while swiping through the images.

A task locking API that lets you temporarily restrict users from leaving your app or being interrupted by notifications.
This could be used, for example, if you are developing an education app to support high stakes assessment requirements.
Once your app activates this mode, users will not be able to see notifications, access other apps, or return to the Home screen, until your app exits the mode.
To prevent unauthorized usage, only authorized apps can activate task locking.
Furthermore, task locking authorization must be granted by a specially-configured device owner app.
Source:
https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html#Enterprise
Additionally:
The App can lock itself by time schedule or an event from Mobile Device Management Tool.

Retrieve visible bounds.
what I think cool is getting the Lat,Long points of visible map layer allowing me to place any useful information on the sides or corner.
for example I can add some text "or anything I please" on the side instating how far is this point to the current GPS location

Add analogy for InstallationManager for Windows Store applications (Windows 8.1) + Windows 10 (desktop).
Because in these platforms I can't get my installed application.
For more details for quetsion/request you can see my question in msdn (https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/46402b2b-86a1-4750-bef5-7297966ada82/uwp-universal-can-i-use-installationmanager-or-some-analogy-in-desktop-version?forum=wpdevelop)

Windows Phone Lacks BackGround Tasking thats why Apps Like TrueCaller, IE application dont run in background.

If SelectionMode is None in a ListView itxe2x80x99s really hard to know which item that is in focus.
Ixe2x80x99m using FocusManager.GetFocusedElement but that just work when the list is in focus.
Also, setting which item is in focus is hard as well.
Ixe2x80x99ve been able to work around this by enabling selection mode temporary, set selected item, and then disable selection mode.
If there are some better way, please let me know :).
The ways I found feels a bit clumsy.
A simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated.

With the ColorPicker control (thanks for adding this, btw!)
there is a bug when changing alpha channel programmatically.
Create a new ColorPicker with Alpha enabled in the UI and a ColorChanged event handler.
(1) Set .Color to a transparent color #00000000.
(2) Then, in a color changed event handler change to 0xFFxxxxxx (100% opacity).
It's important to change the alpha similar to:
            this.ColorPicker.Color = Color.FromArgb(0xFF,
                                                         this.ColorPicker.Color.R,
                                                         this.ColorPicker.Color.G,
                                                         this.ColorPicker.Color.B);
You'll notice the preview color in the UI is correctly updated but the opacity slider and value do not change.
The opacity slider should update when opacity is changed in the code-behind.

I found a problem with displaying html in the built-in browser (IE) windows phone 7.

Support Hybrid (html5, cordova ...) applications and Windows Mobile

I've read about "Project Rome" and the possibility of creating cross-device experiences (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/11/cross-device-experience-with-project-rome/), and am particularly interested in the Project Rome Android SDK (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/02/08/announcing-project-rome-android-sdk/#HQl7ibqTUGYzrufw.97).
I would like to try this out -- making my app an "experience shared across multiple, close proximity devices," but it would be very helpful to see some code samples.
I am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or OS -- the idea of a seamless experience between Windows desktop and Android or iOS mobile is compelling... but I need to see some examples before I invest.
Thanks!

I was surprised cause there is no ResourceDictionary template in "Add new ite..." dialog.
Though Blend has this template.

Android supports text-to-speech and vice versa without online connectivity.
This is great for dictation.

It is necessary for creating screen sharing or remote desktop apps.

From my recent experiences it seems that an app submission can pass certification with no problems, but then a subsequent submission that only makes a very minor code change such as bug fix can fail certification.
I accept that this will probably happen in general because full checks cannot be applied every time and different testers may pick up on different things.
However, it concerns me that one day I will run into the following hypothetical scenario:
I release a major app update which passes certification fine.
I then notice a critical bug in the app which I need to fix as soon as possible.
I release the bug-fixed version to the store, but it spends 3 days in certification and then fails certification.
I then have to work out why it failed and make the necessary updates or etc and resubmit it for certification which could take another 3 days.
That means it's taken me a week to deliver a critical bug fix, which could lose a lot of customers etc.
Note that I have already experienced less serious versions of this scenario.
Therefore I would like to propose the ability to mark an app submission for an already-published app as a bug fix, which would either skip or fast-track manual certification (automatic certification using the Certification Kit would still be done).
I realise this could be open to abuse, but perhaps there are some rules you could produce which a submission would have to obey in order to qualify - for example the app manifest should be unchanged except for the version number.
Thanks for considering this idea.

bring RIP Silverlight deepzoom control to UWP control and pivotviewer too with win2D capabilities

Could you make an option in the SDK installer for just the Tools?
On some of my computers, I only need the tools for phone deployment, such as WinAppDeployCmd.
On the screen "Select the features you want to install", if I select the Windows Software Development Kit feature at the bottom, it installs 1.6GB worth of stuff, including headers, libraries, and source code.
I don't code on all these machines, I only need the tools!
I copied the tools out separately and they are only 106MB.
They work fine without the headers and libraries installed.
An option in the installer would be more convenient instead of me copying it manually.

Before, WPF - like silverlight apps can be runned on a bworser with an extension.
After full access to Windows 10 API's for PWA apps, why we not run UWP applications like PWA on browsers as a cross-platform app ?
It might be ASP.NET Core based and a convert tool for UWP apps like as "Project Centennial - Desktop Bridge" or "Windows Bridge - iOS" will be developable.

Hi is it possible to add "proceeds since last payment" information in the windows phone dev center applications

For example, if in the msi/ appx is added folder, like Samples or Projects, it cannot be found by the open/ save dialogs, with set "Initial Directory", opened by the installed executable, even if the folder is installed in the installed executable's folder.
Actually, initially I constructed the msi by placing the folder in the Documents folder, but the Centennial does not install it there, but in the VFS....
It will be hard for the user to find these kind of folders too.

The skeleton tracking is not working on XBOX.
You can verify this with the CameraStreamCorrelation sample.
MediaFrameSourceKind.Custom is not available on the XBOX.
It is available on the PC, though.
The following streams are available on the PC:
Color
Depth
Infrared
Custom
The following streams are available on the XBOX:
Color
Depth
Infrared
As a result, skeletal tracking apps do not work on the XBOX platform.
Are there any plans to support skeleton tracking on the XBOX?

I am looking after a solution already over a decade for 3D mouses working over Windows Remote Desktop Connection.
Still today 3D mouses USB-connected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly.
On the field, there are hundreds of CAD, industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a 3D mouse on the remote server over Microsoft RDC.
Normal mouses are working fine, but 3D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from 3D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC.
I would like to ask Microsoft Developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the RDC.
Other competitors such as Citrix and HP have already solved this issue with their own Remote Desktop clients.
It would help a lot of companies to invest in cloud systems, especially when small lag 5G-connections are soon here and develop new businesses.
Thank you.

I would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call.
Some basic things to filter would be:
-System library calls
-Greyed out function calls
-Anything that isn't in the current project
-Show external calls only
-Show calls to a specific project
-Finding a specific function in the call stack
Essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules

I've two apps with same name, one is in phone and the other one is in desktop.
Now, I created a universal app.
Tab version have a small number of users, I need to upload new universal package to the phone version app.
But the problem is the App name automatically reserved to the Tab version, and the package name also.
I'm not able to associate the application with the phone build in the store(because the app name is not reserved to this, there is no package name or package id for this in the store)
How can I resolve this issue without changing the name of the Phone Build.
Note: the dev center not showing delete option for this particular name.

There should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the "recent apps" section (on mobile).
Use case:
1) A user is at lunch viewing their sensitive documents.
They switch to their Email app - our application detects active state change and auto logs out.
They finish their food and leave, but forget their phone on the table.
*At this point a perpetrator is able to take the phone, open the recent apps section and now can see whatever our client was looking at.
2) User is at their desktop observing files, gets up and makes the app inactive (minimizes or moves to back).
We begin a timer to auto log out.
* A perpetrator is able to hover over the taskbar item and see the last screen drawn whether or not the user logged out.
We are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system, but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden

Allow us to define InputScope for &lt;input&gt; elements with type='text'.
Specifically, I would like to set it to Numbers.

Currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real-time as and when it happens.
This reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction.

Hello, I am new to the forum, so I apologize if this is not in the incorrect area to post this.
But I hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful.
I am active Windows Insider users, currently enrolled to receive the fastest Windows Inside Builds.
I currently use Cortana each day on Windows 10, Android and iPhone.
The first feature I wanted to suggest is that I believe Cortana is lacking certain capabilities on Apple iOS; specifically the ability for Cortana to send emails from the Cortana App directly by Outlook for iPhone.
Similar to how Cortana handles text messages, it would be nice if Cortana could draft an email onto Outlook for the iPhone.
The second insight I would like to provide for feedback is on the Cortana's speech recognition on Apple iOS and Android and user input.
I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze.
It doesn't matter if I set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone; the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to Cortana is quite noticeable.
The last feature I would like to recommend to the development team is allowing Cortana to read text messages from an Apple iPhone device.
 I understand the limitations of Apple, so it's unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows 10 PC.
However, I would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification, I have received on my iPhone from Cortana.
Thanks for your time.

I thought I had raised this as a platform request, but seems it's showing up in Feature Feedback instead.
Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how (or be told how) to do it, however it's not very intuitive and I'm concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be.
Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The way it currently works is if you tap and hold, you get the "I" cursor to appear.
If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox.
However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the "I" cursor makes contact with some text.
You will see it visually "lock in" to the text when this happens.
I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half (allowing for the SIP) a portrait or landscape screen.
What Would Improve Usability?
----------------------------------------
Two things.
1.
Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto/visible (latter is currently ignored).
2.
If using tap/hold, allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above.
Alternatively
----------------
To provide an experience consistent with the platforms SMS text input capability, provide support to allow TextBox to
1. grow as new lines are added.
2. be placed in a ScrollViewer and have the viewport follow newlines as they are added.
Thanks for considering.

While nice looking, UWP UI is not well suited for creating UI-heavy classic applications (think VisualStudio/AutoCAD/Blender/LOBs with a lot of data) that you would never want to use on tablet/phone.
There should be alternative, condensed and aligned with Win32 style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from UWP improvements.

MediaTransportControls no longer auto-hide correctly for UWP apps on desktop when using the mouse pointer.
When the pointer is used to click the play/pause button, the transport control bar begins to hide and then immediately pops back up again.
This bug does not occur with a game controller.
This appears to be related to the introduction of MediaTransportControls.ShowAndHideAutomatically property in Build 16299.
I am using Windows v1809.
This bug is reproducible in any app which uses the transport controls, including the XAML Controls Gallery app (under Media) available in the MS Store.
The link to the app can be found on the main documentation page for MediaTransportControls here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.mediatransportcontrols

It'd be great if the Slider control could have a TickOffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left-most edge of the control.
For instance, if I have a slider using doubles with a range of [0.5, 3.0] with a TickFrequency of 1, then I see tick marks at 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5.
However, I really want them at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
The TickOffset would move the initial tickmark by that amount, so in the above case, I'd set it to "0.5" to move the first tick mark from the start of 0.5 to 1.0.

When building line-of-business-apps for enterprises, we often focus on desktop only.
Today we're using WPF for these tasks.
But if we want to use UWP for it, we would need a classic menu like we have it in Visual Studio and serveral other "expert applications" (=app with a lot of functionality) that require more than just a hamburger menu or some flyouts

Allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi, bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available.

The Lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from Tile attributes.
To provide lockscreen text its necessary to use the WideBackContent attribute on the Flip tile.
But - if you have generated a custom tile and/or you don't want  the tile to flip, then you cannot use the lockscreen text feature.

StorageFolder.GetFilesAsync() is incredibly slow (~7 seconds for a folder with ~3500 files).
Back in Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight-times, I was able to get the content of the CameraRoll much faster (via the MediaLibrary, &lt;1 second for the same amount of files).
How can it be, that this became so extremely slow with the UAP?

Many small developers skip Brazil and Korea from worldwide distribution because there are mandatory rating agency requirements.

Hello.
In The Class Of Microsoft.Phone.Scheduler.ScheduledTask,
there are property BeginTime As Date, but it is not supported!
Is it possible to support in the future?

The phone currently plays a large selection of media formats (MP4, M4V, 3GP etc) that aren't supported in the emulator.
This makes apps that use these formats extremely hard to debug.
Would be awesome if you could fix this :)

Filter in the ListBox is very important.
It's impossible to select a value when the list contains a lot of items!

Example:
&lt;wp:Notification xmlns:wp="WPNotification"&gt;
  &lt;wp:Tile Id="Guid"&gt;
    &lt;wp:Param&gt;&lt;/wp:Param&gt;//if Click in Tile
    &lt;wp:BackgroundImage&gt;&lt;/wp:BackgroundImage&gt;
    &lt;wp:Count&gt;&lt;/wp:Count&gt;
    &lt;wp:Title&gt;&lt;/wp:Title&gt;
    &lt;wp:BackTitle&gt;&lt;/wp:BackTitle&gt;
    &lt;wp:BackParam&gt;&lt;/wp:Param&gt;//if Click in Back Tile
    &lt;wp:BackContent&gt;&lt;/wp:BackContent&gt;
    &lt;wp:BackBackgroundImage&gt;&lt;/wp:BackBackgroundImage&gt;
  &lt;/wp:Tile&gt;
&lt;/wp:Notification&gt;

Add LoginHint as optional param to LoginAsync() and plumb through GetUserTokenV2Async.
Developers will pass in a UPN (user@domain.com) which will bypass the initial Realm Discovery Dialog - thereby reducing the number of dialogs the user sees during login to the graph.

Apologies if this isn't the correct place to lodge this bug.
If not, please redirect me :)
We have a Unity HoloLens app that calls into a native dll which throws an unhandled exception.
The application crashes.
There are no clues in the Unity logs as you'd expect, as this is native code.
We've enabled Crash Dumps for the app under "App Crash Dumps" in the Windows Device Portal, but whenever the crash happens, nothing appears under Crash Dumps in the same window when refreshed.
This definitely worked in previous Windows versions on the HoloLens.
Could it be a bug that's been introduced?
We're running Redstone 5 (non-insider) on the HoloLens.
Unity is version 2018.1
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog, you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.
If you are using x:Bind to bind that control's value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page, then when you press the primary button the property doesn't get updated.
I've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler, but this does not help.
Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.
The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary or Secondary button in a ContentDialog, then focus should be switched to the button concerned - otherwise x:Bind bindings wont update.

Map became unusable after phone 10.0.15063 update.
Because:
a) It is extremely slow.
ResolveCompleted event comes after ten seconds.
b) It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders.
c) It draws MapPolylines in wrong positions (very, very often).
They take right position then after manual shifting of map, but initially 20-30% of them are misplaced after being added to MapElements collection.
Most often it occurs near map borders.
d) Lines on traffic layer are blurred, jagged and looking bad.

Web view crash with too long URIs
When redirecting from a webpage to a non supported URI that is longer than 2084 characters the Webview will crash without the throwing any exception.
The weird part about this is that if you redirect the webview to a URI starting with http:// or https:// or you send it to a malformed URI (someting:aLotOfText) of the same length it will be able to handle it.

Currently we have to download and configure the silverlight toolkit to get certain UI elements that should really be integrated with the platform.
Please add these to the platform.

Why is it that every single nice API that allows for great things to be developed on this platform has to have some stupid limitation?
Why do you reserve the media formats supported by the phone?
We can't even read a god forsaken txt file from SD cards.
Why even bother introducing the API in the first place...

Adding new test users without new submission.
Posibility to add new test users in real-time mode.
It will be more quickly and easier.

Allow platform built-in camera and video apps to use increase and decrease volume hardware keys for picture optical and digital zoom of camera.
On WP8 add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events  for the lens (plug-in) features...hardware keys should include vol+, vol-, stage 1 (light press) camera shutter, stage 2 (deep press) camera shutter.

Have the possibility to retrieve the pair code from the general panel.

For a classic desktop application, we need a TabControl.
Currently you can use the Pivot or there are 3rd-party vendors providing a TabControl.
But as this is such a central control, it should be part of the platform.
If you build it, it would be great if you could add configurable close-functionality to the tab-header that is bindable to a ViewModel.
Ixe2x80x99ve spent some hours to build a small MVVM/UWP/Pivot Prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in WPF with TabControl.
And I was impressed how far I got.
Sample is here:
https://github.com/thomasclaudiushuber/Uwp-Tab-Control-Spike
Big asks are asks are
* Styling of headers
   ** I think this could be made simpler by support for example a HeaderStyle-Property on the Pivot
* Layout of headers
   ** Currently the Pivot has no overflow-panel.
Itxe2x80x99s also not wrapping the headers.
Maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers.
I didnxe2x80x99t find the option.
* Implicit DataTemplates (not really an issue of the Pivot, but would be great to have these.
I created a separate uservoice entry)
* Styling of content (I was not able to get rid of that entrance-animation (xe2x80x9cslide in from the leftxe2x80x9d-animation/-transition))
* allow for no overflow
* allow for no wrapping

Add a 'FindAncestor' mode to the RelativeSource MarkupExtension for UWP as implemented for WPF.
This would have enabled me to access the IsSelected property of my ListViewItem from the DataTemplate within the ListViewItem's control template directly instead of having to access it via a very circuitous route.

As an app seller, I have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while.
I want to be able to refund a purchase that a customer made - both in-app products and paid downloads.

As an alternative to giving write-access to calendar (which can be hard to get a go on for security reasons), let us at least open an appointment directly in the calendar app.
Would make it possible to make calendar viewers that can behave as a real calendar alternative.
Especially if we also can have a "delete appointment"-chooser (user will need to confirm deletion).

Windows Store Policy for Adult Content:
11.7 Adult Content
Your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit.
Pornographic and sexually explicit needs to be well defined.
Microsoft support working for Report App are taking down apps which have partial, but no ******* nudity.
Partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit.
Game of Thrones is on the Windows Store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic *** scenes, so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered.
Furthermore, Age Ratings in Dev Center Dashboard can be set per app according to the ****** content in the app.
If the app fills out this information there it should not be taken down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material, which is not well defined in store policies.

the user should move and resize the element by mouse and keyboard.
there is floating panel in Xamlbrewer.
but it doesn't support select multiple controls and resizing.
that would support selecting multiple controls as property and then could move in parent and resizing them by user

the following code:
                string _path = @"D:TMPtest0.solaltxt";
                FileStream _pfs = null;
                try
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine($"_path(-)={_path}");
                    _pfs = new FileStream(_path, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None, 4096, true); // &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; OK with 15063, NOT OK with 16299/17134
                    Debug.WriteLine($"_path={_path} _pfs={_pfs}");
                }
                catch (Exception E)
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine($"_path={_path} Exception={E.Message}");
                }
                finally
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine($"_path(+)={_path}");
                    _pfs?.Dispose();
                }
where D: is a USB drive appearing in the Windows.Storage.KnownFolders.RemovableDevices.GetFoldersAsync list, Removable Storage and File Association / '.solaltxt' are correctly set in the manifest.
works ok in version 15063, but not with 16299/17134 anymore: any comment would be welcome ...

LineHeight is pretty important for an easier reading experience and I let my app's users select line height for their own liking.
The regular TextBlock control has this property but unfortunately, MarkdownTextBlock lacks this property.
It would be nice to have.

Please provide some consistency in the certification process.
I submitted a game for publishing on Monday.
It went through the entire process in about 2 hours.
The game wasn't set to be published until Friday at Midnight.
Over the course of the week, some fixes were made to the game's code and was resubmitted for publication on Thursday around 10am.
It's been sitting in "Certification in Progress" now for 2 days.
If it doesn't go through, I'm going to miss my published release date.
If you can't give a reasonable estimation on release times, maybe let us put multiple releases in the queue.
That way, if the second one gets certified on time, it can take precedence over the previous version.

Currently (as of 8.1) when there is an embedded video in a WebView and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands to only the extents of the WebView; which isn't fullscreen if the WebView is surrounded by other controls.
There should be a property on the WebView that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls.

Windows Phone specific but handy in RT in future developments.
A Trusted NFC transmitter should be able to perform "silent" operations if authorized to do so.
A tap on the NFC point on my front door should be able to turn ion (or off) the phone's wifi access, for example.
Obviously, there should probably be a PIN requirement for first use/set up trust but the NFC capabilities of the WP platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference.

There are several certification requirements from Microsoft that are impossible to test without a physical Windows Phone device.
The requirements that involve phone calls, text messages, and zune hub music are all impossible to test from within the emulator.
It'd be very convenient for developers without actual devices to test their apps for the certification requirements if everything could actually be tested with the emulator.

It'd be awesome to create a new Windows App and select "HTML" &gt; "TypeScript + Angular 2".
By TypeScript support I mean: No need to transpile it to JavaScript.
Debugging TypeScript code directly.
Typing information for all the APIs, so it feels similar to C#.
I know, Angular 2 isn't ready just yet but I hope this is something we can look forward to.


So that Windows::Media::Core::MediaStreamSource can use it.

It is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is'nt Show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by Name.
each app must be found by browsing in a category .
even if it's only on page 100th
example: my App "Doppelkopf Pro" in german store has good Downloads but is only found by Name, not in categorie "Kartenspiele" (games -&gt; board and cards) ... my App "Offiziersskat" what has not good Download-Rates but this app is listed in "Top payed"

Following the comments on the blog post for AF_UNIX, it would be nice to see SOCK_SEQPACKET and/or SOCK_DGRAM support.
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/12/19/af_unix-comes-to-windows/
Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.
It also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX-compatible applications, as was the original goal for implementing AF_UNIX.
This would be comparable to the "message" mode of Windows named pipes, making AF_UNIX sockets a more complete replacement.

Editor

Support a greater variety of Microsoft Media Foundation APIs such as the ones that allow adjustment of pitch and playback speed.
Advanced audio APIs would allow developers to create music applications for musicians, etc.
The current list of support APIs is rather limited.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj681688(v=vs.105).aspx

It would be great if MediaControl supported webm format!

When porting my Windows 8 app to Windows Phone 8, I feel that the Universal App template (which is already awesome) could do some other things to increase even more productivity:
1 - Create Pages and UserControl folders: Let's face it, unless we want to create sh**** apps, we won't have the same UI for all platforms, so we'll end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions.
VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.
I have stated the folder names I use (Pages and UserControls) but the rule could deal with other names as well.
2 - I use SettingsFlyouts and I took some time to replicate them as pages in the Windows Phone project.
That could be automatic too.
3 - Likewise, top and bottom app bars in Windows 8 could be translated into the Windows Phone versions automatically, if for example buttons were found in those controls.
4 - Do the same for Styles.xaml (or whatever file contains Templates and Styles) as done in 1.
I believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken, but I only remember these 4 because I ported a very simple app.
I recognize that when Threshold arrives (code matching between Windows and Windows Phone achieves 100%), much of these may not matter anymore, but for the time being these would be nice additions.

In MediaComposition add transitions between two clips on timeline, e.g.
Cross fade.

When I wanted to link my App's website Bing search results with my Windows and Windows Phone Store listings, the app linking to Windows Store linking was accepted, but the linking to Windows Phone listing said:
Not verified
Failure Reason
"The URL {link to WP store listing} is linked to {privacy policy link provided for the app}, but you are trying to link to {website I want to link to}"
Did I provide the privacy link to be linked to the store listing or to put a hyperlink in the store listing in WP to the privacy policy statement?
Please unlink the WP from my privacy policy field so I can link it to my website.

I do not like the recent change in the Dev Center.
First of all, it shows cumulative acquisitions rather than for a specified amount of time, making it hard to compare which apps people like more (if an app has been available longer, of course the cumulative acquisitions will be higher!).
Also, being able to see only some of the apps at the same time is very frustrating.
I liked the previous Dev Center where I could compare multiple apps on the same graph, and just the look in general.

The built-in support for some DPWS devices would be nice, especially printing to WSD printers (or capturing images from WSD scanners) would be a significant feature.
Implementing such protocol is not impossible and printing from applications would be welcome not only by developers but by end users as well - once available in Office applications etc.


Drag and drop is good when you have a ListView or GridView, but when trying to drag other items, there is no simple way to implement this.
I could see digital whiteboard apps being big.
A tray of tools and controls that apply to that app.
Like an inkwell, you select to tool to use in the drawing surface.

Accessibility Bugs:
In the ColorPicker control, when the IsAlphaEnabled is set to true, this is not accessible.
1.
The label for the RGB hex field when it accepts the alpha channel is incorrect.
Currently it reads, "RGB hex...".
it should read "Alpha RGB Hex"  and also provide formatting requirements to prevent mistakes.
2.
Auto formatting is incorrect for 8digits.
If I enter a 6 digit Hex value.
That 6 digit hex value is by default a 100% opacity.
I would expect the auto formatting to respect this.
It's as simple as replacing the "0" with "F".
For users with vision or cognitive disabilities this is confusing and causes unexpected outputs.
It should validate and provide an error message.
3.
If a user enters an incorrect amount of characters, it does not provide validation or an error.
It just replaces the empty characters with "0" and passes it through.
This often has the incorrect affect of making the user believe they entered a correct value, but in fact they didn't and now it's way off of the original intent because of incorrect auto formatting.

The image control only supports BGRA8 encoding and the Win2d Controlxe2x80x99s supported type is also determined by BitmapPixelFormat.
They are very unfriendly to Machine Vision developers.
NV12 and Gray8 are two basic formats, but they don't be supported.
When we get the pure image data without image file head info, we donxe2x80x98t want to chang the pure data.
That
will waste in performance.
So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat, like as WPF .NET Framework.

Please expose Undo/Redo functions on the TextBox control so that we can trigger it programatically.

CoreApplication now has a RequestRestartAsync method, but it fails in a Desktop Bridge app with "NotInForeground".
Could you add this to the list of UWP APIs supported in Desktop Bridge?
I really need to be able to programmatically restart my app.
I wonder if this is because of the way the Desktop Bridge technology wraps the WPF application.
Any ideas on how I can cause the app to restart?

It would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a UWP BitmapImage (which can be significant for large images).
I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures, but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.
I've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).

In order to display more details on network connection, and to distinguish WiFi networks connected to.

I can use Fiddler on my desktop to view my network traffic.
I want to do the same thing for my other Windows devices to help debug my apps.

With WinRT 8.1 new functionality has been added to render XAML as an image but the XAML has to be added to the visual tree.
It would be nice to be able to render XAML that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task.

With Silverlight in Windows Phone, i had the ability to use FM radio APIs.
In UWP, I cannot use these APIs as they weren't brought over.
I would greatly apperciate if these APIs could be added to UWP.

Perhaps as a result of its desktop heritage, or otherwise, Windows for as long as I have known it has eagerly disconnected TCP connections when either the corresponding route or network interface is known by the system to have gone away.
On researching this issue recently, it seems to be related to network interfaces entering an offline state.
This behaviour makes a lot of sense on desktop machines, where early feedback to an application and its user allows the problem to be responded to more promptly: no hung connections that will never return, blocked threads, etc.
However, as a developer attempting to move back to Windows, I'd like to explain a use case where this feature is not only harmful, but may over time become a showstopper, forcing me back to either Linux host OS, or even worse, back to Mac.
The problem is that as an engineer working in infrastructure, particularly with software targeting Linux, most of my work by necessity must take place in a VM where I have access to the exact OS semantics, features, debugging tools &amp; APIs, etc, as the systems my code runs on.
The only way to do that is by working most of the time out of PuTTY or similar SSH'd to a local headless VM.
So far, so good.
The problem is that, given a typical desktop where I may have 10 such windows open, some of which have unsaved changes, should the machine decide to suspend itself, or should I close the lid as I must move it, on resume all those sessions will be cancelled due to the eager TCP resets performed by the OS as part of the suspend process.
I've looked at workarounds for this, and there doesn't appear to be a good one.
My best option so far appears to be using 'mosh' from WSL to connect to the VM, which further requires me to permanently work from the (crippled) WSL console.
To clarify, while shared filesystem would allow making use of an editor from the desktop, and while WSL is a nice work-alike for certain tasks, for debugging system-level software I really need everything - debuggers, editors, Git checkouts, .. on the actual target OS.
I have searched at length for any kind of networking stack tweak that would permit the connections to be preserved across reboot, and found no sign of one.

Today, the UI designer could not work because it cannot parse the node.
"mobile:Extension".
It could be good to have it fixed to allow to continue editing settings + visual assets in a Gui rather than in the xml editor
 &lt;Extensions&gt;
        &lt;uap:Extension Category="windows.search" /&gt;
        &lt;Extension Category="windows.backgroundTasks" EntryPoint="Local.CallerIdBackgroundTask.LocalCallerIdBackgroundTask"&gt;
          &lt;BackgroundTasks&gt;
            &lt;uap:Task Type="phoneCall" /&gt;
          &lt;/BackgroundTasks&gt;
        &lt;/Extension&gt;
        &lt;mobile:Extension Category="windows.phoneCallOriginProvider"/&gt;
      &lt;/Extensions&gt;

Something in both Silverlight and WPF but missing from UWP - Tiled brushes!
(Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes... just without tiling :'( )
This will allow use of tiled images (and perhaps videos) for use as brushes anywhere a XAML Brush is accepted - like Backgrounds, Text foregrounds, Path fills, etc.

Lower payout.
For some countries it's $25 while for others is $200.
It makes no sense that for Brazil it's so high, specially considering the currency value.

Enable support for Biometric frame work API's for UWP so that we can develop stand alone apps for reading/storing/authenticating with the help of finger print on a central/kiosk devices.

It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage, or similar.
However if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted.
Or for instance we are in a setup wizard we don't want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup.

Currently the only way to take advantage of the direct manipulation in a XAML Windows store app is by using a ScrollViewer.
However that isn't always appropriate.
For example if one wanted to implemented a fixed columns Excel type functionality where the cells of the first column should not scroll horizontally but the cells should participate in the vertical smooth scrolling and where cells in the first row (and header) should scroll horizontally but not vertically.
There really isn't a way to prevent some of those from scrolling since the ScrollViewer's Direct Manipulation implementation will animate/offset the rendering in the compositor thread well before the UI thread gets any notification (e.g.
ViewChanged).
There are other situations as well where a control may need custom handling of the direct manipulation (e.g.
synchronizing scrolling of several disconnected elements).

What exactly are you asking for?
- I don't see any gherkin in 2gis's stuff
You can already do gherkin (using SpecFlow for example) with this tool.

use new csproj format* for uwp apps.
*the one used in dotnet core applications

Allow changing the country and name after registration on Windows Phone Store, PubCenter and Windows Store.

App-specific launchers: instead of opening a site's web page, check whether a compatible app is installed or registered.
UX is much better and

I would like the ability in XAML to conditionally have my XAML output be compile with flags like you can currently with c#.
A great use case of this would be having a debug flag for additional information that is relevant for my app

Currently the ManipulationDelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinch/stretch events.
Providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios.
It's awkward to have different means of resizing objects.
The Whiteboard app, for example, resizes graphic images with pinch/stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios.
Text boxes, on the other hand have little "handles" attached to use for resizing.
With separate x and y scale measurements, both objects could be resized via pinch/stretch.

Allow screen capture to be taken from background task OR through mdm protocol.
This is useful for techs using mdm systems - for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support, they can request a screen capture and help them resolve.

Provide an API(s) that allow apps to either control Settings (eg, being able to toggle WiFi when NFC tag is interacted).
Also, it would be nice if there was an API that allowed an app to be integrated into the Settings Applets, instead of a standard app.

Please open a dedicated forum to DesktopAppConverter
Support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the Windows store is below anecdotal.
Its a pity.
Like thousands of other developers, I have tried for now over a month to convert my app, and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft, but am still stuck with dependencies.
Tried to post in UWP apps but questions remain unanswered.
For such a strategic move, where the Windows Store could remain indigent as during the painful Windows 8.x era if nothing is done, please make sure developers do not remain in the cold.
Thank you.

The new fall creators update seems to have introduced a 'feature' where if a user reboots the system, any applications that were open (well, some at least, it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing, not all applications follow this convention) will automatically launch on reboot.
Some users certainly will find this useful.
Others may find this annoying.
Sadly, if you're someone who finds this annoying, there's no option to disable this behavior.
According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?page=2&amp;auth=1) there is no way to disable this.
I would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings, allowing users to disable this feature.

So we can have apps that will able to change our desktop wallpapers daily from the Windows Store

I work in a Microsoft store and I get alot of feedback from customers wanting certain features.
Voice to text limitations are really bugging people.
You should be able to do V2T anywhere you can type.
For example this submission would have been so much quicker if I could use V2T, instead I spend about two minutes typing this up.

if the homescreen's tile automaticaly arranged in recent , most used, favart, and latest updated.
then it would be better

Currently UWP Community Toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better, it would be awesome to add more and more services, including a big one for a lot of people, WordPress.
Could this be posible?

For example, MS provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about Win10 Fall CU.
The SDK itself support the side-by-side installation, then we can try the new API with our UWP Apps.
But, there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win10 Insider preview.
It only allow the Customer Update SDK level.
I belive that Store should control the SDK level more grained.
You know, many of Microsoft Apps are updated with new SDK, and it'll be available at the store during Insider Preview.
If our - ISV - UWP App also have this feature, we can spent more time to trying the new feature, and Insider customer and testers can use it, and we could got feedbacks.

The current design documentation at xefxbbxbfhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn958439.aspx provides only files in Powerpoint and Adobe Illustrator formats.
My company and thousands of others use Sketch to develop app interfaces, that we then give to our developers.
None of Powerpoint or Illustrator files are supported by Sketch and vice-versa, so we need Sketch files to start our design work.
Thanks you very much

We are migrating an application from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.
The first problem that we encountred is that in WinRT enables to add an Service Reference of WCF and in UWP is not yet implemented.

Liechtenstein is not really different to Switzerland.
Add it to the list for payouts.

This Idea has already been posted for WinRT 5 years ago: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2831450-implicit-datatemplates-for-winrt
I'd like to have implicit DataTemplates in UWP.
The main scenario is MVVM and resolving a View from a ViewModel.
This scenario is described in this post: https://www.thomasclaudiushuber.com/2017/03/10/building-a-classic-tabbed-and-databound-desktop-app-with-uwp/

Enabling developers to access a the data sent to the device screen for displaying.

With F# still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using UWP after several years of people waiting, I want to call for bringing Common Lisp to the platform.
Developers deserve a first class functional language to develop UWP apps in and MS had used Lisp for MS Bob way back in the day.
Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions.

When submitting a WP 8.1 app, it is possible to submit an app that passes certification if there are visual elements referenced in package.appmanifest that aren't present in the package, i.e.
The app will pass certification, but when anybody tries to install the app from the store the install will fail.
Certification, or package analysis on upload should be updated to check for referenced resources that aren't present in the package.

If you request an offset for a location that is outside of the visible map portion, the returned point is not computed using the same Dpi than a location which lie inside of the visible portion of the map.
Currently, we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of map.ActualWidth and map.ActualHeight.
If the point is outside, we have to divide the result by RawPixelsPerViewPixel.
a point with a location near the top right corner of the map and inside the map will have an offset of 319,0
if the location is slightly on the right, the returned point will be 481,0 instead of 321,0 (you have to divide it by a factor of 1.5 on my Lumia 635).
Please fix that anoying issue.

When the application is unpublished by Microsoft, the reason in sent by email.
When the email is not received (like in my case) the developer doesn't know the reason.
However this can be easily fixed by writing it in Dev Center.

Depending on the app, we do not always want to show the built-in delete buttons for a TextBox (the X on the right edge of the TextBox).
I have, in multiple scenarios, had to create a ControlTemplate to avoid displaying the Delete Button.
I think there should be a property (maybe something like ShowDeleteButton) that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed.
This property would have values Show, Hide, and Auto (or maybe a nullable Boolean).

MAXPATH is giving me a severe headache lately!
I've been trying to compile some stuff and the compiler is necessarily creating processes with enormous arguments.
Everything would be fine, but MAXPATH is too short to let it succeed!
This is the only reason I've got to switch to linux, as I'm not in a position to change MAXPATH or rewrite the way the compiler calls processes.
PLEASE MICROSOFT, HELP!
If we can't eliminate it, at least give the option to change it, even if its hard to do.

I have been trying to get my son into programming and so far his dev experience has been less than exciting.
He wants to debug his game real time, but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc.
Allegedly this works, however, I have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because VS gives useless feedback.
I have spent an entire day trying to get something, anything working.
if I choose device, I get a generic error (vie tried every suggestion I can find online), if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin, so I go into the "for devs" page on my device and I hit pair and I get a 6 digit pin.
that pin doesn't work though so the pin screen wont go away.
I was able to finally build an app package that I can manually move o the device in the portal, but I shouldn't have to do that, and it breaks the debug chain.

Currently an app can have only one extended execution active at any point of time.
If an app has two components each of which have some important work, say saving data, and they want to take an extended execution session for that, they can not do it independently.
The app needs to have a 3rd component which coordinates the sessions across all the components.
Instead the OS itself should have this coordinator and the app should support multiple overlapping extended execution sessions.
This allows the app to be written in a properly decoupled manner.
For equivalent functionality on Android, each component could independently take a wakelock to do this.

It is currently possible to change the background brush of the NavigationView itself, but the Pane, in particular, is not so straightforward.
Users can modify the designated ResourceKey, but cannot change this brush outside of XAML.
Users would benefit greatly from a "PaneBackground" property that can be set to an AcrylicBrush, etc.
Especially, since the pane of this control is currently opaque by default in a WPF XAML Island.
To reproduce this situation, please create an "XAML island" in a WPF application.
Setting the child to a NavigationView.
Then, from C#, search the NavView object for a simple PaneBackground property.
Currently, this is nonexistent.

The windows phone developer site should have a place where app developers can search for URI schemes used in other windows phone apps, and get relevant documentation for them.
When submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any URI schemes your app includes in the manifest file, or mark them as private URIs if you don't want to document them.
This idea came from a conversation around Matt Lacey's blog post: http://mrlac.eu/1lxwDi4 where he found over 300 URI schemes from some of the top apps in the store, many of which do not have any publicly known documentation.
Currently the best place to find documentation for URI schemes is the Nokia Dev Wiki http://bit.ly/NokiaUriSchemes but this information should really be available though Microsoft.

Windows Phone 7 is inclined more towards individual user experience.
Even as a developer we can create most of the apps for individual users that is standalone.
If we need to target corporates then then we would need more APIs for device management, also like Zune (for a single user), we would need an Enterprise Server Application which can control the devices (of employees) remotely where we can apply corporate policies on the device as well.

In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.
Could this not also be provided in the UWP toolkit for inclusion in UWP apps?

I think that having and IAP price point of $0.49 could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers.
Having $0.99 as the bottom for things like ad removal, when many *full apps* cost $0.99 can sometimes be a tough sell.

There may be trusting problems.

We are having some issues with the Pivot where we make a clean run of a pivot and we open some tabs, when we close them the memory stays allocated to the App.

I need a way to remove files from my WP8 device which have been "disliked".
Since apps aren't allowed to modify files on sd cards I wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been "disliked" and then remove them.
However this is impossible with all existing API's.

The automatic migration of an APP 7. x or 8.0 to 8.1 always had errors that needed fixing manually.
However, these mistakes were easily fixed because the old dashboard inform us what the information was wrong and what was expected.
So it was enough to get into the manifest file and replace the information.
AFTER THE MIGRATION TO THE NEW DASHBOARD THAT DOES NOT OCCUR ANYMORE.
Errors are pointed out but does not show information that is expected.

It is more convenient to go with swiping gestures is more fun being with than the tap method.
However, there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.
To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu, as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'.

Allow applications to define custom shaders in HLSL.
This will allow sophisticated game graphics and real-time image processing.
Also allow access to MP4 encoder library (hardware accelerated) so apps can generate their own videos.
This should also allow apps to read existing videos, modify frames and write them back.

The WinRT GestureRecognizer class doesn't provide support for the typical gestures one might use on the phone such as swiping which it conflates into the same gesture as pan (drag).
This means that developers must implement their own gesture recognition (I'm basing mine off of Apple's superior UIGestureRecognizer classes) which will result in the users having different gesturing experience in each app.
Please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like Apple's approach which works better than what's currently there.

Please add a semi-automated "test queue mode" to Driver Verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have Driver Verifier test them one at a time, moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot.
I selected a set of 3rd party drivers and my PC immediately failed to boot.
Now I have a painful regime of monkey motion to go through to test them one by one (even with binary search it's going to be painful).
An automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this.
Thanks in advance for considering this.

The media pipeline seems to be broken in Windows Phone 8.1.
It seems to have a lot of problems with memory management.
When creating a background audio app that uses IMediaSource to stream audio in Windows Phone 8.1, the app's components eventually throw OutOfMemoryException and even StackOverflowException under some circumstances.
When looking through the memory dumps, there's a lot of uncollected garbage inside.
Here is a discussion on MSDN forums (see latter posts):

Currently, the only way to upload the user files to the ISO storage is to use the cloud-like services (Skydrive).
It does not make a sense when the large (multimedia) files have to be transferred (You first have to transfer them up to Skydrive and then - download to phone).
It would be great if the part of the application ISO store could be made visible in the Windows File Explorer when the phone is connected by the USB cable.
Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited.

Windows Runtime API has presented Frame class, which page caching and navigation logic differs from a corresponding Frame class from Windows Phone Silverlight API set.
This new Frame class gives a lot of pain to developers, because in many cases it cannot provide such app and navigation state management, which can be used to create good and predictable user expirience.
Therefore, I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frame's behavior closer to it's analog from WP Silverlight.

Hello Microsoft,
Please provide APIs and support of iBeacons technology and also BLE scanning without pairing just like using "Advertising Package", so that we can exchange data to or from target device.

There are more and more external sensors, not only medical, but all kind of proximity stuff for watches, smart apliances, cars, and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps.
As usual Microsoft is late in this too, and so we have to focus development on iOS and android that have the SDK up to date with technology.

At the moment, the periodic task runs every 30 minutes.
My suggestion is to make this interval configurable.
For example, if you want to retrieve gelolocations frequently in the background.
It is just not possible to do this at the moment.
Other platforms (iOS and Android do support this!!!!!).
Let the user decide what he wants (concerning battery life etc).
Don't define restrictions for developers.

Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search.
The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing!
search.
Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.
If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available.
This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway.

Add a control similar to react-joyride, that helps in creating instructional ui.

Currently, there doesn't seem to be any possibility to disable the "bounce" effect when scrolling inside the WebBrowser control which makes any apps based in HTML5 look and feel cheap.

Would it be possible to disable this?

Or connect phone to PC with usb cable and browse through windows explorer to Music folder - you will find the file with .mp3 extension.

Currently when using a ControlChannelTrigger with HttpClient you cannot send a HTTPS request without the application getting terminated by the system.
This means we have to transmit data insecurely if we need to use this feature.
I tested using HTTPS and to my surprise it does work with the debugger attached, no exceptions get thrown, so it is implemented.
However termination occurs when the application is NOT connected to the debugger.
As this post (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uwp/networking/network-communications-in-the-background?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#controlchanneltrigger-with-httpclient) confirms, SSL is not supported when using a ControlChannelTrigger with a HttpClient

I have used Unity+UWP to develop LOB application that visualizes 3D data from opened files.
We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available.
Now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files, which would have been easy with Win32 (just launch another instance).
One of the problems in here is Unity code, which is mostly made to be single-instance, but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app.

We're seeing a range of interaction glitches with the ListView control in UWP, when the "drag to reorder" behavior is enabled.
You can see this in the standard UWP demo, DragAndDropSampleNative, in its first section ("drag and drop to reorder").
Compare the behavior between the leftmost list ("All items") which has no drag-to-reorder and the second list ("Selection").
1) When using pen on a ListView to scroll (standard OS behavior since Windows 1709), almost every time you stop scrolling / lift pen, there's a "flash" on the ListView - it grays out briefly and then returns to normal.
2) When using touch, there's a nice visual effect: when the listview switches from scrolling to drag-to-reorder, the contents gray out and indent to tell you that you're now in "drag" mode.
Now that pen mimics touch, it would be really useful to have that same "gray out" effect.
3) The touch graying out behavior has one visual glitch:  if you drag left/right (out of the listbox), the listview will flash white and then gray again.

Suggestion for Pathicon "DataUri Property" for loading PathIcon from a Svg File, instead of specifying messy vector strings, nobody really wanted to put this stuff ("F1 M 16,12 20,2L 20,16 1,16") in their xaml.
Example:
        &lt;PathIcon
                 DataUri="ms-appx:///Svg/MyButton.svg"
                 HorizontalAlignment="Center"/&gt;
Notice: "DataUri Property" and Resource path ms-appx:/// pointing to svg file added to visual studio project under an Svg folder.
Another possibility is to allow DataUri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff: "F1 M 16,12 20,2L 20,16 1,16".
Example:
        &lt;PathIcon
                 DataUri="ms-appx:///PathIcons/MyButton.txt"
                 HorizontalAlignment="Center"/&gt;
Then, MyButton.txt can contain:
    "F1 M 16,12 20,2L 20,16 1,16".

Unable to prevent auto close of InputPane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of InputPane in UWP with target version 16299 on Tablet.
If we have to move focus from one input to other and in this process of focusing next element if input pane was opened in first input and 2nd input element needs UpdateLayout for showing InputPane then InputPane for 2nd will not be opened on tap ( you have to tap input if you are getting focus through Tab button on InputPane, to open InputPane which is also a bug as by default it should show InputPane like you get focus by directly taping that input box for getting focus).
For opening InputPane for 2nd Input element you have to tap outside to lose focus then you will have to tap that input again which will focus input and will open InputPane as its focused now through tapping not by tab button of InputPane.

I noticed this problem as soon as I adapted my app to use ImageEx.
I use an event to change opacity to 1 once the image is loaded and sized, and immediately I noticed that instead of just displaying, the image faded in with a 1-second animation.
This animation seems hard-coded into the style, so to get rid of it I would have to redefine the style.
A real pain just to get rid of the animation.
I would question a fade-in animation as a default to begin with.
Please add an option to get rid of the fade-in animation for opacity.
Thanks!


The gyroscope will add new types of gameplay to the games.
The gyroscope has long been used on PS3, PS4, Wii, Wii U and other gaming systems.
It's time to add it to the XInput standard.
It would also be cool to make a new gamepad with a gyroscope.
A few examples of using a gyroscope in games.
1.
First person shooter, Third person shooter.
In shooting, the gyroscope can be used for more accurate aiming during shooting, for reloading, repelling an enemy, driving a vehicle, for balance when overcoming obstacles and so on.
Wishes for developers: optional use of the gyroscope and changing its sensitivity.
2.
Race.
Gyroscope will allow using the gamepad as a steering wheel.
Wishes for developers: optional use of the gyroscope and changing its sensitivity.
3.

The gyroscope can be used for jumping, with varying strength, for rotating platforms and so on.

At a minimum I need to have 2 images that are auto selected based on the phone's current theme.
SplashScreenImageLight and SplashScreenImageDark would be great!
After that, it would be great to have the option to select an image from IsolatedStorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed.

Can you please expose the Viseme events for the windows speech sythesis.
I use them in the speech SDK for a desktop application and are now trying to use them in a UWP app.

Both on my iOS and Droid I can use my work email exchange server.
However the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those OSes.
WP7 will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if I know it is okay.

Security for the user is reduced by each app having to store credentials to online services e.g.
Facebook, other third party services.
i would suggest a common credential store such as accounts where users would need to be prompted so the application could access the token, username or password.

Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication.SerialDevice can't receive data in some cases.
To reproduice:
1) Take sample from here: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/tree/develop/Samples/SerialUART/CS
2) In MainPage.xaml.cs change line 97 from serialPort.BaudRate = 9600; to serialPort.BaudRate = 115200;
3) Comment lines from 105 to 108, where serial device settins read.
This should be commented:
tttt/*txt += serialDevice.BaudRate + "-";
tttttxt += serialDevice.DataBits + "-";
tttttxt += serialDevice.Parity.ToString() + "-";
tttttxt += serialDevice.StopBits;*/
4) Run application and set breakpoint ReadAsync method after line
if (bytesRead &gt; 0)
5) Connect to port and try to send data to it
6) You will see that "await loadAsyncTask" never ends...

I would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device.

There is some dangerous tendency in the industry to phase out RSS support in favor of proprietary REST or similar APIs.
That's simply wrong because RSS is a well-known and established open standard, that successfully accomplishes its mission.
To encourage use of it, RSS platform APIs absolutely must be exposed to Modern apps.

We would like to register as a developer in Windows Store.
But BVI is missing in the list of countries .
Please add.

Apps on Windows Phone were able to run under the lock screen for quite some time.
The new universal app model does not provide this functionality.
This should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps.

Please add support for child windows, popup windows and MDI for Universal App Platform in Windows 10

I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder, to make them available offline.
Because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available.
So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later.

Add the support in the Visual Studio designer to preview another language than the app default language

Daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis, in the same way like periodic tasks.
This would enable apps like Skype to work in background and show incoming call nobtification.

Evidently, the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() API internally uses the StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessLists API which has a limitation of 1,000 items.
If you add more than 1,000 clips created via MediaClip.CreateFromImageFileAsync(), the API will fail with this exception:
WinRT information: The maximum number (1000) of items in the access list has been reached.
An item must be removed before another item is added.
Additional information: The maximum number of items for the access list has been reached.
An item must be removed before another item is added.
Evidently, this is a limitation of the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() APIxc2xa0- it should be fixed.

Windows 8.1 supports both these audio codecs under Shoutcast streams.
Windows Phone 8.1 still doesn't.

Looking at the VfsOps.ps1 file it seems that the Test-Path on line 138 assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard, not a file name.
Looks like it could be fixed by adding [Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape(...) somewhere, but I haven't been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that I can test this...

When you open an Image.
Minimize it and right click on minimized icon and then select close window options .The Image is not getting closed.
Is this a bug.
I am facing a similar problem while with my own developed UWP

As a developer working on a submission, I don't want to see erroneous errors on the store listing page.
When typing in the What's New text area, a message "Release notes canxe2x80x99t be more than 1500 characters" with a red (X) glyph appears when you reach 1458 characters.
There is no actual error and submission completes.
The error is in error.
I'm okay with a friendly warning, perhaps a glyph replacement?
Yellow exclamation?

Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low-level Direct2D for rich text rendering capabilities.
Win2D (C# Direct2D wrapper for UWP) library supports callbacks for custom glyph rendering or custom text positioning.
But this library is fairly low-level.
There is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without Direct2D or slow manual composition inside Canvas control.
There is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup.
RichEditBox control exists, but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text (RichTextBlock isn't related to RichEditBox and feature-lame).

Change country on dev center account.
Cant believe this isnt possible.
If you wont let me change the country, at least let me close my account and recreate it!

The new WinRT MIDI APIs are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed.
In addition, the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms.
There is information on this in the other MIDI topics on this page, and on GitHub if you do an issue search for "winrt midi" or "uwp midi".
Please look into how musicians and developers use MIDI and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the Surface, and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here.

Could you please have a report that includes the prices, before the final payment?
Companies need to have the correct sales estimate for the accounts purposes.
Thanks

As a developer I need access to the current logged in active directory user to check if the user has a specific role.
Normally I do this with:
WindowsIdentity currentUser = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent();
var groups = currentUser.Groups;
groups.Claims
So I can get the SID or the groups of the user.
Most companies want to control the access of the user by the active directory.
The enterprise application uses this information whether a user got access or not.
If there is no api to access this information, enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting.
Please help us out!

This is about the Microsoft.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer class.
In FrameServer mode, there is no way to get the timestamp of the frame that is delivered by the callback VideoFrameAvailable.
Therefore is it not possible to display the frames smoothly.
In the previous Media Foundation API the timestamp was included with the frame.
Could this functionality be added in to the next update of the MediaPlayer class?
Thanks,

Request for an editable combo box that allows:
- keyboard focus for the edit box
- ability to type a value that matches an item in the dropdown
- ability to type a value that does not match an item in the dropdown (enabled as a control option)
- auto complete of the item name while typing
- keyboard navigation for opening the dropdown using Alt + down arrow.
- keyboard navigation for moving through the list of items in the combo by using left and right arrow keys

Better support for Commands for all controls, allowing to bind a Command in the ViewModel to any event from a supported control in XAML, without having to use third party tools such as MVVM Light.
(no offense MVVM Light ;) )

As the audiences from the Business Store and the Retail App Store are different it makes no sense that to publish to the Business Store you have to submit the app to the Retail Store.
This means ISVs will have to deal and support non-business users.
Please decouple this workflow and let ISVs submit their apps to the Business Store and NOT to the Retail Store.

Developers must be given additional enumeration values in Socketype and ProtocolType to create variety of sockets like raw sockets based on ICMP, IGMP... etc.

Today, when users click a link in IE, most of the times you would get a message that this content type is not supported on phone.
Altough there are app like office, acrobet reader and many 3rd party apps which handles the particular content-type.
We need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using IE, they can choose installed application to open with.
Today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user.

Include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro 2 for both WP8 and RT

Currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub.
We, developers should check the developer dashboard every day and day.
It's tooo painful.
Is it possible to add the notification system?
Just ping by mail is enough.
Uservoice already have it.

DataGrid should detect IItemsRangeInfo in order to support virtualization.

As for the "?"
button on windows to access the help manual, a "@" button would allow developers to receive feedback from final users.
It would work both for Microsoft, e.g.
Windows 10, and for third party applications.

Hey guys,
it's extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter, with no knowledge if they are investigated or not.
I don't want all the time contact support, wait, wait, wait and "yeah we have issues", or now is just Saturday...I've to wait til Monday?
With service issue, I mean, devcenter backend is down or doesn't work properly in some ways.
Cam'on we need a service status page, with "we have issue, we're working on".
At least we're not totally in the dark, in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days.

Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled, this really needs to be more granular i.e.
providing access for users to install apps under certain categories while restricting other categories

Fact 1:
Current only Microsoft Movie &amp; TV app have this capability, when User play HDR video the TV will indicate it's output HDR color format
Fact 2:
Microsoft Media Player don't support HDR
Fact 3:
so as my Video Player App.
even though Hardware decoding HEVC HDR Video Sample will not HDR output , color seems over exposure, beacause not enough Color space availabale.
Please expose this Feature for Developer, even just as a restricted capability will be sufficent.
refer to:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/chuckw/2017/12/15/directx-and-uwp-on-xbox-one/
UWP on Xbox One apps have limited access to the High-Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities of the Xbox One S and the Xbox One X.
For games looking to implement HDR, contact the ID@Xbox program.
this blog is focus on Games but not Apps.
How do i implement HDR for my Video Player.
Receive many 1 star rating, beacause missing HDR support.
many user send mail ask for it.
but nothing i can do, beacause platform limitation.

In windows forms, it is easy to have users print without a dialog and to code the printer output to use a specific paper bin.
This functionality is missing in UWP.
One of our applications has users print checks from a shared check printer with the check stock in tray 4.
700+ users as 52 sites do this and it has worked fine in VB6 for the last 16 years.
Now that we want to upgrade the applications to a modern environment, we find that UWP does not do it and WPF makes it hard leaving only Winforms.

We need the PivotViewer control for WPF and WinRT please.

We are supposed to get KeyUp events even if the event is handled if we hook up the callback using
    UIElement.AddHandler( UIElement.KeyUpEvent, new KeyEventHandler(xe2x80xa6), true)
However, this does not work correctly for the ALT key.
If you press the ALT key and release it immediately then you do get the KeyUp; however if you press and hold the ALT key, then release it, you do not get the KeyUp.
You do get KeyDowns.
I am guessing this relates somehow to the AccessKey system -- ?
I am using Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform 6.1.7 on Windows 10.0 build 17134.

After application migration to the new dashboard, use the original product ID to bind High German map failure

With Phonegap build in 5 minutes I can upload an App on Android and IOS platforms, instead I spent one day to discover that the .apx file provided for the WindowPhone Store is not accepted by the upload form in the windowphone dev center.
More information please.

I understand the max size limitation to control.
And there are some approach to work around on most of the controls.
However, for some control, e.g.
TextBox, it's a big problem.

This System for featuresuggestion is good, but I miss the feedback to the feedback.
At the moment only one idea is marked as planed.
Even some of the ideas will ship in the next Update they haven't marked as planed or startet.
Which would give the people that use this Platform give a positive feedback and get there Votes back without manualy search for votes they no longer need because it will be provided in the next Update

If and when Android apps or if they are used as a universal windows app.
Please could you organise them and put them into categories e.g Snapchat with social media etc.
This could work :)

TypeConverter is helpful because it allows the author of a type to provide intrinsic support for determining to/from which types a type may be converted and actually converting between types - most typically for converting to/from string but other types as well.


I have built an app that targets Windows 8 and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on Windows 8.
I have got the fix ready, but in order to produce a fix I need to be able to compile with the Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows 8 (Xaml).
Is there anywhere I can find a copy and download it?

Companies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this, but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform.
Using Roslyn (as DuoCode does), UWP Applications written in Xaml and C#/VB.NET get transpiled into JavaScript and rendered via HTML5 canvas.
The results of which could be hosted anywhere that HTML5/JS can run, notably iOS and Droid platforms.
Or even on a regular ol' website.
A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.
That way, there is truly *ONE* WUP application codebase, and it can truly work *anywhere*.
Native .NET for Windows 10, JavaScript "for everything else."
There would be no reason to ever learn another language/platform paradigm.
Microsoft wins.
:)
Ironically, this would truly make UWP "Universal."
Please consider this idea!!
!

Dear Dev Team!
Please provide an API for quiet hours in Windows 10 (mobile) where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background.
Thank you

It'll be great if we can rename "Submission 1" to something else..

You would finally be able to add and customize your alert and text sounds!

Read email access Locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for UWP apps.
Please, allow us to achieve this!

With the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well, this should be implemented to make UWP apps much easier to distribute outside of the store.
Apple does this already with there apps (scroll down to the "Outside of the Mac App Store" section": https://developer.apple.com/macos/distribution/

It will give users the full access over android apps and it will even be much more cooler than pc blue stacks as it won't need button configuration for touchscreen options.

Get public tweets without user's authentication

I believe that developers should have the same amount of control over the CommandBar &amp; AppBar in portrait &amp; landscape.
In landscape, the CommandBar cannot be minimized to xe2x80xa6, while it can be in portrait.
I feel that it is important to be able to minimize the CommandBar in Windows Phone apps because there is limited screenspace, so even something like the CommandBar can make a difference.

System is deleting and recreating the TLS self-signed certificates for the device portal on port 50443 a lot.. sometimes every 5-10 minutes in the windows log.
For sure it resets them every reboot.

With x:Bind we can invert a boolean property with a ValueConverter like this:
Visibility="{x:Bind IsLoading,Converter="{StaticResource BooleanInverseConverter}"
But wouldn't it be much cleaner for that widely used boolean case to write just this:
Visibility="{x:Bind !IsLoading}"
To generated the code should be possible, and also to check in that generation whether IsLoading is a boolean or not.
Even without checking, it won't compile if IsLoading wouldn't be a boolean, which is fine.
Thanks,
Thomas

I've opened a new UWP project and added this button to the main page:
    &lt;Button PointerPressed="Button_PointerPressed" PointerReleased="Button_PointerReleased" ...  /&gt;
I've put a breakpoint in the event handlers, and they only fire when the right mouse button is clicked.
On a left-click, nothing happens.

Save for a few narrow use cases, apps are prevented from working in the background (the current backgroundtask has too many resource constraints (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh977056.aspx#Background_task_resource_constraints) to be useful).
This effectively makes creating entire classes of applications (file archiver, video transcoder, ftp/irc clients, to name just a few) impossible.
I understand power consumption is a consideration, but a more balanced middle ground, like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and/or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring (liek Android does in its notification bar) so that they know why battery life is being impacted, would make the WinRT environment much more useful, and in turn drive adoption.

The SetPreferredMinSize() function should allow window sizes greater than 500 x 500px.
We are currently developing for desktop-only screens (we have control over the device types), and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than 992px x 700px.
This application is far too complex for mobile screens and 500 x 500 is too small.
Is this an option we can hope for in the near future?
Thank you,

Hololens let's you render on 2 backbuffers(stereoscopic) but it's hard to know if the output is correct because the emulator shows just one frame.
I assume it's the image for either the left or right eye.
When hololens is in stereo mode, show both frames on the emulator.
Let the user  choose between spit-screen or Anaglyph (Red-Cyan).

My app contains in-app purchases but customers can not buy these in-app purchases in the Windows Store for Business.
See also https://technet.microsoft.com/nl-nl/itpro/windows/manage/apps-in-windows-store-for-business.
The only option for now would be to make a separate 'Pro' app.
But that has a very big impact on maintenance, because we would have to support 2 apps.
Can in-app purchases made available to Windows Store for Business?

For WindowsML and MachineLearning.NET applications we need to monitor processor usage specificly by AI processes in task manager.
This would be well placed in the task manager Performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ML activity.
The graph could reflect Machine Learning usage whether the process is performed in the CPU / GPU or a dedicated ARM ML / TPU style unit

It would be nice to have a command-line tool to submit apps to the store.
This will make it possible to have continuous deployment process for the platform.
Give the public yet another reason why the windows dev platform is the best.

A business feature that would be really nice to have support for it the ability to tie into a VoIP network for voip phone calls... the most common architecture is the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).
So I would like the ability to configure a SIP client that ties into our VoIP PBX and phone system.. so my WP7 would basically become my desk phone (extension).
The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.

We have a very large WPF application built upon the Virtual Earth API with heavy customization of the rendering pipeline.
We are exploring moving forward with UWP, but currently there is no way to access the pipeline to add custom shaders and models like we do now in Virtual Earth with Microsoft.MapPoint.Graphics3D.GraphicsEngine3D and Microsoft.MapPoint.Rendering3D.Scene.Step.
Please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the MapControl class.

Whenever I want to update an App I have to use the "Add new package" function instead of the "Replace Package" function because this is lacking of support in Firefox.
Therefore I have to reenter all the app informations and screens for each update done.
Please add support for this function in Firefox.

Allow apps to be hidden/visible in the store without having to go through the whole update process.
Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal, just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden.
Handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users can't download your app and instantly think the app is useless

Ada 2012 has the ability to express pre- and post-conditions and add them in an easy manner; if these were to be put into the APIs you could block erroneous data from being passed into the API's function, which in turn should make things more stable (or at least give more meaningful error-messages than 0x80072f8f, 0x800f0906, 0xc004f074 and the like).
Ada also has excellent language-interfacing and can directly import C and C++ functions w/ ease, so you could use Ada as a simple glue-language, merely letting it perform your pre- and post-condition checking for you.

The following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine:
1.
Connecting the host to a non-corporate (remote) WiFi network.
2.
Connecting to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect on the host.
3.
Start a VM and connect it to the Default Switch (NAT)
When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect, the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses.
The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses; however, it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network.
This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/commercial/incidents/117111417156306) and a Connect bug (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/feedback/details/3142497/build-16299-15-hyper-v-default-switch-nat-name-resolution-not-working).
Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue.

You should be able to select, from a drop-down menu or text box, how much memory is required for your app to run, or select what devices to test for.
My apps keep getting rejected because they are being tested on devices that they were not designed for.
Other dev sites let you select these options during the submission process.

An app can easily provide its own calendar to the OS, so the appointments are shown in the build-in calendar.
This is a very nice feature!
Unfortunately, there doesn't exist an API to do the same for tasks (todo-items).
The build-in calendar-app only presents tasks from Exchange- or Outlook.com-accounts.
It would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks / todos to the OS.

Arrow keys do not move between radio buttons if the containing StackPanel has TabFocusNavigation="Once".
If the containing StackPanel has TabFocusNavigation="Local" (or is not set) then the arrow keys will not move back from an initial RadioButton to a preceding Button in the StackPanel.
Like this:
&lt;StackPanel XYFocusKeyboardNavigation="Enabled" TabFocusNavigation="Once"&gt;
&lt;Button Content="B1"/&gt;
&lt;Button Content="B2"/&gt;
&lt;RadioButton Content="R1" /&gt;
&lt;RadioButton Content="R2" /&gt;
&lt;RadioButton Content="R3" GroupName="X" /&gt;
&lt;RadioButton Content="R4" GroupName="X" /&gt;
&lt;RadioButton Content="R5" /&gt;
&lt;Button Content="B3"/&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
While this example includes Button as well as RadioButton, the problem is evident even if you only have RadioButton.
With TabFocusNavigation="Once", navigation gets stuck at R1.
Starting with focus outside of the StackPanel, the Tab key will take you to B1, arrow key will take you to B2, another arrow key takes you to R1, but then it gets stuck.
Further arrow keys will not move you off of R1.
Desired behavior is that arrow keys move you freely through the Buttons and RadioButtons.
On the other hand with TabFocusNavigation="Local" then: starting with focus outside the StackPanel, the Tab key will take you to B1 and repeated tabs will take you through the other Buttons and the RadioButtons.
Back-Tab will also take you back through the Buttons and RadioButtons.
However xe2x80xa6 if you tab into B1 then right/down arrow keys will take you to B2, R1, R2, R5 as expected; but then another right/down arrow key will not take you to B3 as expected.
Left/up arrows will take you back from R5 to R2 and R1 but not further back to B2.
Another way to demonstrate the problem is to build the XamlUIBasics example in the Windows-universal-samples project (on GitHub) and add TabFocusNavigation="Once" XYFocusKeyboardNavigation="Enabled" to the StackPanel containing the RadioButtons on the RadioButtonPage.

Allow us to view all error reports stored on the device.

The TextBox control is the most used control in a Windows program.
It also cause a lot of problem either from QA or the user because of invalid data that was entered.
Using a masked control will save a lot of time for the developer and reduce the complaints and bugs

Having native access to OpenCL or C++ AMP support would be nice to have, especially with the newer hardware arriving with WP8.

Allow UWP sideloaded apps (distributed outside of Window Store) to formally use the Store Payment and Licensing infrastructure.

Expose an API that allows apps aside Phone and Messaging to trigger Person reminders.

I use Direct2D to render complex shapes and animations.
I would like to include them in my XAML layouts.
The existing solutions like SwapChainPanel have many limitations like -
- transparency
- layering XAML-Direct2d-XAML is not possible
- Direct2D effects cannot be applied to XAML content (e.g.
Text)
- etc.
One solution would be that XAML finally switches to Direct2D for the rendering of shapes and controls.
This would surely make the integration with Direct2D content much easier.

Make the IsLocked property of the Pivot control in WP8, bindable as a dependency property.

I wish the InterstitialAd will have built-in animation, at least a fade-in effect when it shows.

When you place a Pivot in a SplitView Pane it behaves very strange.
Headers don't react to click/touch under certain circumstances, swiping doesn't change the active PivotItem most of the time.
The content of the PivotItem seems too wide - wider than the SplitView Pane.
The Pivot behaves normally if I place it inside the SplitView Content though.
So as far as I can tell the combination SplitView Pane + Pivot is the cause for this problem.
Why I want to do that?
I want to achieve something similar to what Visual Studio Code does in its sidebar.
But the Pivot fits perfect for my use case.

All I need is TraceMft.exe to view some MSDTC logs.
I assume the tool is at most 1 meg.
Apparently I need to download 6 gigs worth of SDK just to get that one file.

Hi everybody,
I'd like to make proposal for improvement FltSendMessage function return value.
The case is when user calls it with non-zero timeout + reply required and function exits with STATUS_TIMEOUT.
The problem in this case is that there is no way to understand was message delivered in user mode app or not.
Thanks,

I reported this bug in the "General Windows Desktop Development Issues"
MSDN Forum on 2013-12-05.
It got noticed by some guy from Microsoft,
but then nothing else happened.
See
https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/073d02a6-1181-4694-9e50-d6a05bd80663
This bug is still present in the Windows 10 Technical Preview,but the
below text from my original bug report doesn't explicitly refer to
Windows 10.
In Cygwin we're using the CreateSymbolicLinkW function to create native
symlinks.
Preferring a simple code path, we don't make a distinction
between short pathnames &lt; MAX_PATH and long pathnames.
All pathnames
given to CreateSymbolicLinkW are long path prefix prepended
(?C:foobarbaz), including the symlink target path .
The resulting
symlink reparse point contains the path prefixed as expected (the `dir'
command proves it).
This workes fine so far in all circumstances since Windows Vista, up to
and including Windows 8.
Windows 8.1 has a problem, though.
While it's
no problem to create a native symlink in Cygwin, and while CMD handles
these symlinks just fine (`type symlink-file' works as expected, for
instance), the ShellExecuteW function refuses these files:
- In Explorer, double-click on such a long path prefixed symlink will do
  nothing at all.
- Calling ShellExecuteW in our own `cygstart' tool returns with an error
  code SE_ERR_NOASSOC.
As I wrote above, on earlier OSes, the ShellExecuteW function (and thus
Explorer as well as cygstart) works with long path prefixed symlink
target paths without any problem.
To me this looks like a regression in shell32.dll in terms of handling
symlinks.
Below's the source code of a simple, self-contained testcase, written in
plain C.  It's *very* simple, even using fixed pathnames, to concentrate
only on the symlink and long path prefix issue without leaving room for
variability.
I added comments to the source code to explain what the
testcase is doing.
As the header comment claims, I tested the scenario
with a lot of different OSes from Vista/2008 to 8.1/2012R2.
The
misbehaviour can be reproduced only on 8.1/2012R2, and only when calling
ShellExecuteW on a symlink pointing to a target pathname with the long
pathname prefix ?.
The source code is generic enough to build with VC++, MingW gcc or
Cygwin gcc, as 32 bit as well as 64 bit  executable.
The behaviour is
independent of the target CPU (i686/amd64) and the build environment
(VC++/gcc).
Hope that helps.
I would be grateful to get some feedback about the
state of this bug.
For the testcase source code, see below.
Thanks,
Corinna

In UWP, the Tapped event does not fire on a UIElement for the second time if it is double tapped.
There are many situations where is necessary to handle rapid tap events from the user as separate taps, not double taps.
Now you may think that the IsDoubleTapEnabled property can solve this.
However, this property does not do quite what you think it might.
It merely prevents a UIElement from being the OriginalSource of a double tapped event.
So if you set it on an element with a template (e.g.
a button etc), it does nothing, since the double tapped event will be initiated by an element within the template.
You might this that (slightly cumbersomely) you could get around this problem by putting the contents of the Tapped handler is a separate function and calling this function in both the Tapped and DoubleTapped events.
However, this is not the same as handling two separate Tapped events since the DoubleTapped event fires after the second pointer press, not release.
You might then consider using a gesture recognizer, but this is even more cumbersome, plus then you can't really use the bubbling feature of the event and set Handled to true etc which is sometimes useful.
Therefore it turns out to be impossible in UWP to handle bubbled tap events in rapid succession, which is pretty inconvenient and seems like a very basic thing one would want to be able to do.
The easiest way I can see to solve this is to add an alternative Tapped event, which behaves exactly the same except it fires even if double tapped.
If you would consider this, it might be worth considering at the same time that the Tapped event can currently be invoked by other mouse buttons, such as back and forwards, not just the left button, yet there is no way in the tapped event to tell the difference between these.
So if you do follow this suggestion, then perhaps either add a property to the event args to be able to determine which mouse button was pressed, or called the event 'LeftTapped' or something, and don't fire it if a mouse button other than the left button is pressed

Hello!
!
* Scenario: An application saving different file formats with the same file extension (example: choices for TXT files when saving with Excel, MS Office).
* Case (tested): When using FileSavePicker with UWP, even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected.
FileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension.
* Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex), and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants.
This means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the FileSavePicker dialog, which I think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience.
* Suggestion: If the returned StorageFile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user, maybe the FileSavePicker could do it with a read-only property or method after the user confirmed the file.
Thanks.

For jumplist there is JumpList.IsSupported() to check if jumplists is supported.
I would appreciate something similar for tiles as well.
I know that IoT doesnxe2x80x99t support tiles at all.
And some platforms maybe donxe2x80x99t support secondary tiles.
I guess notifications has the same limitation (I havenxe2x80x99t check thought).
I work around this by checking device family.
Easy, but that just doesnxe2x80x99t feel right :)

When playing with BackgroundAudio on WP8.1 I've notcied that when Here Drive plays drive command (example 'turn left in 100 meters'), the subscribed event to SMTC.PropertyChanged is not fired.
As I think it should at least change SoundLevel to Low.
In some apps this may be considered as a bug.

It would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in UWP without creating custom control template.
Reveal effect introduced in Fluent Design should also work.

Suppose Windows is misbehaving.
Suppose the best way to demonstrate the misbehavior is to create an MP4 file (a video).
Suppose I want this to happen under program control.
My program.
Not Microsoft's program.
Suppose I want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with.

The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win10 Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon ( https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone ) because the api reserves the use of many data section types.
This limits the capability of the btle publishing api to manufacturer specific payloads.
It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons.


Wanted to use /list to work on automating the installer for a container image, and there's a ****** check in place that blocks this scenario because the SDK is already installed.

Download Windows SDK on a machine with Windows SDK installed
2.

When functions and FallbackValue is used in an x:bind at same time, the parameter must match exactly.
For example:
&lt;TextBlock Visiblity="{x:Bind nullToCollapsed(VM.Data), Mode=OneWay, FallbackValue=Collapsed}"/&gt;
private nullToCollapsed(object obj)=&gt; val == null ?
Visibility.Collapsed : Visibility.Visible;
you'll get an error if the type of VM.Data is not object.
Generated code:
            private void Invoke_M_nullToCollapsed_2303236444(int phase)
            {
                global::System.Object val;
                if (!TryGet_VM_Data(out val)) { return; }
                global::Windows.UI.Xaml.Visibility result = this.dataRoot.nullToCollapsed(val);
                if ((phase &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; 0) | NOT_PHASED | DATA_CHANGED)) != 0)
                {
                    XamlBindingSetters.Set_Windows_UI_Xaml_UIElement_Opacity(this.obj13, result);
                }
            }
the variable "val" shold be defind with the type of VM.Data

The system is able to recognise when apps are uninstalled, it would be great if it could end an event to the dev center in order to give developers an idea of how many active devices their app is running on.
It would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes, etc


In WP7 you can add multiple accounts of different types (Live, Google, Facebook, etc).
It would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts.
For example, get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails.

Sometimes you want text trimming to occur from the left or middle like "...some of my text."
or "C:Long Path...somefile.txt".
The TextBlock TextTrimming property should have an auxiliary TextTrimmingPosition property which defaults to Right, but can also be set to Middle or Left to support the same types of scenarios but in the other locations.

Since the "Screen times out after" option has the maximum time for only 5 minute and as a consumer perspective it's okay, but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the Visual Studio shows the message like:
"The application could not be launched for debugging.
Ensure that the target device screen is unlocked and that the application is installed."
Like other platforms are having the option for "USB Debugging".
The same could be implemented in the Windows Phone so that developer can use it hassle free.
A general use case is that I'm working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now I stopped debugging and now I started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the device get locked and again if I debug the app then the same error popups.
So please add a "Developer" option and put the  best options for the developers in that menu.
Thanks

Tuenti is a social network as Facebook (in Spanish or English or Catalan), it would be very useful for spanish people or south americans or people who have signed up on it, to have it (integrated) into the people hub.

Hello,
I don't for how long but I noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de Windows app store seacchresults.
If you type in a keyword or search on "Windows PC apps" you also get mobile only apps in the results.
PC apps are harder to find this way.
Also I noticed that in the Mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword.
For expample  searchword "Tinder".
Is this new policy or is it a bug?
Thanks!

This is my personal "favourite": mobile - file open picker - the app suspends but it cannot be debugged.
All sorts of surprises can happen with a complex app.

It's supremely annoying while developing to have to go through the certification wait time just to add an in-app purchase product to the dev center.
I'm not sure I can think of a reason that any certification is needed for these; they're merely a price, key, and type.
Please remove the cert process for these and allow them to be added *instantly*

The lack of Reflection.Emit in UWP significantly impacts the ability of developers to create clean, AAA-compliant unit tests in an MVVM environment (the recommended architecture for building UWP apps).
With no Reflection.Emit it is impossible to build a Mocking framework for providing testable implementations of interfaces used in Dependency Injection.

It's virtually impossible to tell how much you will be getting paid in paid apps and IAPs.
The reserved amount updates daily but that's never the actual number paid out.
For example, if you see $800 in reserve, there needs to be a way to know that you might expect about $500 of it to be paid while the rest is held over.

The current design of the CameraCaptureUI on Windows 10 desktop/tablet renders it useless.
In Windows 8.1 :
- The CameraCaptureUI was shown in full screen
- You could take a picture by clicking anywhere on the screen
In Windows 10 :
- The CameraCaptureUI is shown in a very small window
- You have to click on a small button to take a photo
How to you intend your Surface Pro users to keep the Surface steady with one hand, while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand?
Can you at least give an option to make the CameraCaptureUI fullscreen?
So it's possible to hold the Surface with 2 hands while being able to click on the button (like the Camera app...).

The ability for applications to follow the data connection of the device (especially Edge/3G etc.)

You're building on a TreeView-control, as your backlog on https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/platform shows.
I'm using the TreeView of your official samples on https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView.
The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF.
So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP.
It makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the TreeView.

The majority of apps I see at the marketplace doesn't have any review's.
I think that has an overall negative effect -user wise, community wise and dev wise..
Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it.
 ( I know that thinking up such a system isn't easy, as you would have to think carefully about abuses)

Windows should allow additional user accounts added to track &amp; review the application review process similar to what Apple and Android apple stores allow.
The team across Development, Support and Business are able to track the progress of app review.
This helps in understanding the timeline for publishing the app.


At the moment you have to add the, up to 8 screenshots, one at a time.
Since computers were invented to save time, I suggest we be allowed to upload them all in one zip file - using numbering for the file names and the portal could place them in the right order.

Right now it's not possible to add screenshots for AddOns in Windows Store.

If I use this XAML definition, it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview.
For this reason, I insert:

in the content of GroupStyle.HeaderTemplate.
Now it work, but...the the Header of first group is not displayed!

http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=8ac17275-e5a7-49e0-b144-5a8cd77229b3
In my scenario user can choose to add or remove to the background image an arbitrary number of pictures, so I had to handle this, since on January I implemented this mechanism on Windows 8.1 for another app, I used the following in my Tap EventHandler code to remove selected picture from the panel:
MyContentGrid.Children.Remove(sender as UIElement);
Where MyContentGrid is the parent, a Grid in my case.
The previous code works very good on Windows 8.1 and on Windows Phone 8.1 without update, but when I ran my app on a device or an emulator with WP8.1 Update and every time I invocated the event handler app crashed without raising any kind of Exception, there was no way to handle Exception, I also tried this.UnhandledException += App_UnhandledException; in my App.xaml constructor but there was no way to understand why my app crashed, I also looked at memory consumption, but memory limits were always respected.
I Solved my problem removing all children from the sender that was a grid, but in this case Ixe2x80x99m keeping in memory the empty parent.

StatusBar is error prone for a few reasons:
1.
It's application-centric, not page centric, so a bug on a particular page can effect the app even after a back or its navigated to another page.
2.
It's too easy for show/hide calls for StatusBar progress to be asymmetric.
Most of the time, you're probably having StatusBar's progress follow a Task.
A Task can throw an exception.
A Task can complete successfully.
Putting the Hide in the finally clause may not be good enough if there is UI stuff happening in the try block after the task completes.
You might throw up a MessageDialog in the catch clause.
It would be nice to have a ShowForAsyncAction method or something so that you have one call and don't have to worry about cleanup.
3.
So you can show and hide the status bar.
And within the status bar, you can show and hide the progress indicator.
But maybe I want to have the status bar hidden and have it drop in to show progress without doing two shows and two hides.
Also you have the problem where its easy to type StatusBar.GetCurrentView().HideAsync() when you meant StatusBar.GetCurrentView.ProgrressIndicator.HideAsync().
It would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each.

When games get released on Steam, Valve promotes the game for free, by displaying it to 1 mln users.
You could consider doing the same.

Rob Caplan [MSFT] recently wrote elsewhere " There are several ways for a control to do custom rendering that weren't available when this thread was fresh.
In particular, Xaml/DirectX interop allows a large amount of flexibility to create custom rendered controls."
However, I have spent the better part of a work week trying to find a _practical_ approach to custom rendering in WinRT/XAML controls and have found nothing.
As near as I can tell, I can either use UserControls, template controls (which seem to be just a glorified version of UserControls, in that one is still limited to aggregating existing UI elements instead of defining one's own), or going whole-hog down the road of DX interop (hardly a simple matter, and completely different from the WPF paradigms).
In WPF, one can override the OnRender() method of a FrameworkElement, or the VisualChildrenCount property and GetVisualChild() method, to customize the rendering of a control.
These techniques give a custom control complete control over the display of the control, while remaining in the retained-mode paradigm of WPF.
I can find no equivalent in the WinRT API.
Basically, it ought to be possible to recreate from scratch any existing control, by using the paradigms in the managed, retained-mode API.
This, in spite of the fact that there are numerous such requests over at least the last three years for exactly this.

Earlier this year (but with cppwinrt still new!)
I created a complete complex UI using cppwinrt's programmatic support for xaml: e.g.
StackPanel(), Grid(), RowDefinitions, Column Definitions, Children().append(), etc.
Quite a lot of work but it easy to read and ran great.
Is all of that gone?
Or is there still a way to use those cppwinrt features?

When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems.
It requires the company account to be signed in to raise the case.
This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the 'master' account name and password with lots of people, thus removing any value of using AD federation.
A better option would be to add a new ROLE option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues.

The last three days I was working hard to solve a problem, submitting our UWP app to the store.
Now I know why it was not working and I want to make my knowledge public.
Maybe it will help someone.
Problem:
We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.
 A new version fails the certification process with xe2x80x9c10.4.2 App Crash or Freezexe2x80x9d
Debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine
Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines
The xe2x80x9c.appxbundlexe2x80x9d xe2x80x93 package created by the xe2x80x9cbuild for storexe2x80x9d process contained in the AppPackages/AppName*version*_Test folder is also loading without troubles.
(This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain)
But the xe2x80x9c.appxbundlexe2x80x9d xe2x80x93 package extracted from the *.appxupload  (this is the zip-file uploaded to the store) fails at startup after it was side loaded on my test machine.
(for side loading you need to install the *.cer file contained in the AppPackages/AppName*version*_Test folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots) OK. Something must be wrong with the uploaded xe2x80x9c.appxupload xe2x80x9d package.
WRONG!
The xe2x80x9c.appxbundlexe2x80x9d contained in the xe2x80x9c.appxupload xe2x80x9d contains the .net dlls and not the compiled code from the native tool chain.
This package does always crash after side loading it.
So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process!
Now things are very complicated:
-          The uploaded xe2x80x9c.appxuploadxe2x80x9d package contains the .NET dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the Microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup.
The same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds.
Unfortunately, there are no more details available from the certification process.
Also Microsoft support could not help me.
They build a package which fails without details and I can not download the build package for debugging.
Thatxe2x80x99s bad!
-          Fortunately, I have found a way to use the Microsoft certification build server to get a downloadable UWP package for debugging.
I used test-flight.
The test-flight certification process builds the same package internally.
Fortunately, it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process.
So I was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging.
And it crashed at startup!
Yeah!
Using some gflags and VS I was able to find, that the entry point for xe2x80x9cFormatMessagexe2x80x9d was not found.
-          Entry point for xe2x80x9cFormatMessagexe2x80x9d not found: After some searching I found this https://github.com/AArnott/pinvoke/commit/2843cb918562050fd4e6df1f3fca0c72f4812eb4 and yes, I was using this library with the old version.
The problem here was, that for some VS releases the xe2x80x9cC:Program Files (x86)Windows Kits10App Certification KitSupportedAPIs-x?
?.xmlxe2x80x9d file contains some entry point definitions for FormatMessage which does not exist.
So the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup.
But why was it working on my local machine?
This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.
Unfortunately, the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?
?.xml file which generates broken packages for our UWP app.
After I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll  which contains a workaround for the problem, all was fine.
(If you are also using PInvoke.Kernel32.dll please install the nuget-package directly to the UWP-project, automatic references added by other nuget-packages like PCLCrypto add an older version, verify the version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll in your bin/x86/Debug build output folder, it should be at least 0.5.147.53150)
So, in short:
-          The Microsoft Build server for submitted UWP packages is using a buggy xe2x80x9cC:Program Files (x86)Windows Kits10App Certification KitSupportedAPIs-x?
?.xmlxe2x80x9d file, which allows bindings to non-existing function entry points causing app crashes for the certification process.
Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.
Here the SupportedAPIs-x?
?.xml is fixed!
xc3xa8 Microsoft should fix the SupportedAPIs-x?
?.xml for their build environment!
xc3xa8 Microsoft should give us the possibility, to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging.
I hope this helps!
Regards,
Thomas.

When an application has problems or when a problem is detected in advance by the developer, until the publication of the correction version the client is without knowing what is happening.It would be possible for Microsoft to implement a communications resource developer for customers who have installed its application?
This way we can give a satisfaction to all who buy or evaluate our applications.This communication channel can use the Bing Translator to generate the statement in the languages in which the application has been translated.
I believe it is a feature that will cherish Microsoft to customers and that demonstrates respect for the consumer.

UWP still lags all features of regular ADO to connect to any DB.
Using EF6/7 will only provide direct access to SqlLite and not regular DBs.
MS shall change EF7 to allow DB connectivity via batch data return like 50/100 return records at a time instead of "SELECT *" returning entire DB-Table data in one shot.
Without this feature definitely not all windows apps will be ported to UWP for the simple reason - "We don't want to write another AZURE service to handle DB activity".

There is currently no indication that an application is being featured, it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates / countries it will be featured in.

add can access sd-card from WDP :)

The current developer ecosystem for WindowsPhone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the Marketplace.
Internal use of apps is defined as a "beta test" and requires a list of Live IDs designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app.
This is very limited and also time consuming.
Ideally, a company may wish to dedicate a group of Live IDs as testers to be used each time.
Allowing for tester groups or "profiles" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially for multiple products, by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the Marketplace as a beta.
Additionally, it would be great to have additional support for Enterprise developers that target a specific set of clients as opposed to the public masses of the Marketplace.
First, an Enterprise Developer account could be established with a cost of, say $499, which is high enough to deter hobbyists or smaller companies from enrolling, while at the same time providing additional benefits to larger "enterprise-level" corporations.
For this cost, a company would receive two unlocked WindowsPhone devices that could be traded or upgraded.
This allows a team to use these devices for testing, as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations.
The Enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level - either in-house or to clients.
The Targeted Distribution approach doesn't seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients.
Ideally, a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients.
It could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app Marketplace.
Together, this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the Marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices.

Bring modern Windows UI to existing Win32, WPF and Windows Forms desktop apps with the option to adopt islands of Windows.UI.Composition and Windows.UI.XAML content incrementally.
Allows desktop apps to incrementally adopt UI innovations and creates a bridge to UWP for app UI.

Home automation is a huge market for Windows devices.
A big piece of this is being able to monitor/control IP Cameras such as the Foscam HD cameras.
Being able to discover, enumerate, and stream video from and audio to/from these devices as part of the UAP platform (instead of wonky solutions like ONVIF) would be awesome

if more elements one day.
We cant see the other:(

When I try to insert a new Bank Account I receive an error because there is a validation that the Bank Account should be in the same Country of my account.
I think this is not correct, because using Paypal I can receive money in another country but I don't want pay extra costs for Paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account.
Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.
P.S.
: there is another post that I voted because I can't change the country in my account.

When there is a bulk update requirement, as with the age ratings (and soon to be with the Ad support changes), the store is poorly equipped to server those of us that are managing large portfolios and millions of users.
There needs to be a better way to get a list of all apps that are still awaiting certification approval.
Right now I have to manage this myself.
The current status only seems to show xe2x80x98In Progressxe2x80x99 if the app has never been put in the store before.
I have lots of apps that are just now showing that they have passed certification, days after simply doing the Age Rating update.
I am manually having to keep a list of these when it would be easily managed in the Dashboard if the status properly reflected this.

When you apply new policies on already existing, especially  if it is related to name, all the existing credibility and market is lost.
App is in store with current policies at that time, there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff.

As a developer we should be able to create subusers who has no access to sales data, kind of release manager role we can assign to them.
Currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps, easily know the revenue earned.
More I earn, more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps.
Please take a note of this.
Both Apple and Google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role, who has no access to sales/revenue reports.

Synced with the team, we are working on this :)

As explained here:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa362910.aspx
BTHPROTO_RFCOMM is the supported protocol
Please add BTHPROCO_L2CAP, to allow us to use a lower implementation...

Allow UWP apps to register a shortcut like [ctrl] + [F3] with the system.
When that shortcut is pressed by the user, the UWP app should be launched by the system.

When initiating a chat session, the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field.
There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first 38 characters to the support technician, but that apparently is the limit.
This leads the user to have to type AGAIN the whole description.
This ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator, needlessly.
Please set a limit, and if you are going to ask for a description, make it at least 100 or 255 characters long.

QRCode should support chinese

The keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches (particularly in the desktop Zune application) would, if ranked by frequency, provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts.
This would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want.

The default MenuFlyoutSubItem allows you to add subitems either through XAML or the Items code behind property.
It would be nice to be able to specify an ItemsSource and automatically populate it with MVVM.

Every phone u use except windows, we write a name on dial pad , contact list has shown.
But in windows every time we hav to open contact and search name..
Ex.
To call jack , we hav to write 5225.
List will appear and we select from list n call.

I recently had a rejection with this policy violation:
App Policies: 10.4 Back Button - Games
For games, when the Back button is pressed during gameplay, the game can choose to present a pause context menu or dialog, or it can navigate the user to the prior menu screen.
However the policy document for Windows Development does not state this in 10.4.
Updating the policy to include this as well as any other undocumented certification requirements can save everyone time.

I have a set of TimeSheet/Timer apps that use the badge notification to show the number of hours that have passed.
It is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges.
If I can schedule in advance that the Badge will be 1, one hour after execution, 2 at two hours after and so on, I wouldn't need a background task every half hour to check if the badge needs setting.
It should follow the same rules as Scheduled Tile Updates.

Add shadow option to XAML UI Elements.
Example usage: &lt;Image Source="ImageLocation.png" Shadow="5,5,5,5"/&gt;
Each number represents the shadow in each side.
Why?
One of basic fluent guidelines are shadows, so it should be easier to devs use it, without the need of 3rd party toolkit or calling the Composition directly.

The store does not allow a developer to update their response to a user's review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will.
A user may change his review completely, and the original response could become totally irrelevant.
Developers should be allowed to update their responses at least after users update their reviews.


We would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps, enabling enterprise customers to optimize a user's day by analyzing time on applications.

I would like a way to change where the emulator VHD files are stored.
Changing the Hyper-V default location does not seem to have an affect.
When running a small SSD for your C drive the emulators can take up a large amount of space so it would be nice to move them to a second hard drive.

if you try to open an file by file type association / linked filetype, then you will have no file access to most of the open file with this app-scenarios.
the only way is to grant file and folder permission is by the folder picker, which itself have no default-folder parameter.
So this is really terrible for an app !
Solution: when open by a file type association, the at least a simple dialog should ask: Allow access to all those file-types or to the folder or only that file.

It would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add-ons in Developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add-on again and again.
Also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app.

Scenario: we have a red that's an integral part of our identity.
Our users are asking for transparent tiles (including primary tile).
Problem: when we set the background color in the app manifest to transparent, our logo and store listing banner is no longer red, but is set to whatever accent color user has set.
This leaves us in a bad place where we have to either sacrifice our branding or don't provide the required functionality
Proposed solution: have an independent color setting for Store-specific branding


If you change the DataPackageOperation to Copy, the problem goes away.
Repro project: https://github.com/riverar/DragDropWobblyRepro

My App has no choice 18+, submit audit, report feedback 18+, audit failure

When watching videos I don't get audio through my bluetooth headphones, but I do when just listening to audio.

Currently you can assign to ApplicationBarIconButton an icon present on your project as 'content'.
This basically means you have to determine your icons at design time.
By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage, the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime, dynamically download them from other places etc.

When you use the DefaultItem property of the Panorama control, it's as if you're just rearranging the items.
I use this property to restore application state after tombstoning, but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves.
The correct behavior would be if the panorama were to immediately scroll to the default page (whether animated or not)

An essential and very beneficial feature, that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user.
Example, An app, that allows users to select a time i.e; Tomorrow 10,30 AM to do "something".
User can also choose to run "everyday, every week, etc".
I have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks, and when I tried to implement scheduling I was surprised to see that this is not available on Windows.
(TimeTrigger won't serve this purpose, as
1) it at least requires 15 minutes slot
2) it has the trigger time between 0-15 and not on exact time.
Working on this request at the earliest would be really appreciated.
This feature is available on Android (I heard even on iPhone)

I would like the ability to Pull to refresh be built in.
Currently it is part of a sample.
https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlPullToRefresh

That's ridiculous there's no way to check vibrate mode until SDK 7.1.1!
Are you serious, Microsoft?

Have you experienced the stroke deletion using the standard InkCanvas/InkTollbar against the ink deletion experience on the Sketchpad app?
The Sketchpad app give you a way more natural to delete strokes because it allows you to delete ink by single point, like an eraser on the real life.
At the moment the UWP APIs does not expose such a way of erasing strokes, you can only erase the whole stroke, and in order to achieve the ink deletion by point there is a lot of code to write as well as having the appropriate know how.
What do you think of an extended toolbar where you can have the sake Sketchpad app without writing one single line of code

Negative reviews are bad, especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users.
Similarly to iOS, please display current app version and also show the app version of the user reviews in the store.

Every app places the search control in different areas, often hidden under a sub-section of the app.
It would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application, rather than loading Bing which is rarely the goal.

For example: After purchase an app, users receive a unique code or URL for same app and them can send to another user and the end user redeem the code or open URL for add the app to his account's

It is physically impossible for me to play my game in the emulator and capture an image of it that actually represents what gameplay looks like.
My game is controlled by the Accelerometer and has very rapid gameplay that makes switching from using the Accelerometer to Screenshot tab and actually capturing a screenshot impossible.
It simply doesn't work.
In order to take the screenshot it takes 2 mouse clicks and about half a second.
If I am lucky I can do it before my character dies, even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere by the time I actually take the screenshot.
As such I can't capture the gameplay occurring in my game.
What I am asking for is some key that will act like the Screenshot-&gt;Capture command without me having to change tabs in the Emulator window or release the Accelerometer.
Even something as simple as ctrl+S would be a godsend for me.

Add support for VB.NET WithEvents feature.
In contrast to += in C# the AddHandler statement in VB.NET does not create a handler method.
Thus one has to manually dig through MSDN to find the correct signature.
The WithEvents clause in VB.NET allows to add handler methods the VS code designer by selecting the events from a ComboBox at the window top.
Some (all?)
UWP classes seem not to support WithEvents.

So, I had this great idea for an app... Got a good chunk of it coded, then found out that SmsComposeTask doesn't have the ability to attach images as an MMS.
Is this coming in a future release?
Ideally, EmailComposeTask would get it as well....
Thanks

It is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic window-background effect in a non-UWP window.
Several developers have managed to coax out the private API used to implement this feature in a desktop app (see &lt;https://withinrafael.com/2018/02/01/adding-acrylic-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps-redstone-4-desktop-apps/&gt;); however this API is officially unsupported, can change at any time, and has been changed in a backwards-incompatible manner once in the past.
Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this?
Using the UWP acrylic API in a XAML Island won't quite work for me, as I want to place WPF controls (and not UWP controls) on top of the acrylic background.
Even if the API can't or won't be officially stabilized, a wrapper that forwards to whatever the current API is would be much appreciated.
Note that a Windows Forms implementation probably won't work because of deep-seated incompatibilities in the Windows Forms architecture.
A WPF-only solution is enough for me, however.

MapControl.GetOffsetForLocation return -1,-1 when it fail.
I would prefer it return a boolean or an enum with the Fail reason.
Probably when the location is outside the camera frustum...
It would be nice if we could have a function to clip a path to the camera frustum.
(to draw it as an overlay, with Win2D for example as it is faster to refresh than using MapPolyline...).
The best of the best would be to have a DrawingContext on the MapControl :-) with DrawLine etc...
I need to implement a such thing for my own project.

I would like to be able to define new quick setting tiles that would interact with my app looking like the native ones, having multiple possible states (e.g.
two like the location tile or more like the brightness tile).
An user would get notified that new quick setting tiles are available when an app publishes them and go into notification and action options to view and add them to action center.

In desktop's AP, it can be set by SENSOR_PROPERTY_CHANGE_SENSITIVITY property:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318991(v=vs.85).aspx
But it has no similar property on UWP's api.

Allow user to send Video, Audio and more pictures in an MMS now only one pic is supported

I made the mistake of registering a dev account using the type company instead of individual.
Now I cannot change it to individual.
This is not good enough.
I have to be able to change dev account type.
Please make this happen as soon as possible.

I suggest to create another option that alternates "lost of signal" and "bad signal".
Create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time.
From 1 to 10 sec, for example.
A an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it.
Things like throttling and dropouts
The new emulators in the Windows Phone 8.1 tooling provide some excellent tools for emulating bad network connections, but there is no option to simulate broken connections

Ability to add a custom buttons to system call app, like in screenshots
http://bit.ly/incomingScreen
http://bit.ly/incallScreen
click on button will launch some callback which will access to:
1.
Access to call voice stream in/out
2.
Access to call controls, can initiate a new call, end exists, etc, all features provided by standard buttons on call page

It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.
Example: Create a reminder that starts today, ends in month, and reminds the user every Tue.

Should be able to use the UWP advertising SDK and adcontrols in WPF/Winforms apps so that they can be monetised

Scenario:
App language is English (FlowDirection: LTR)
Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right (as if dragging the item to the left, revealing options behind it.
EXPECTED)
User changes the language to Arabic (FlowDirection: RTL)
Expectation: User swipes from the left to the right to reveal the options on the left (as if dragging the item to the right to reveal options behind it)
Currently: user swipes from the right to the left to reveal the options on the left (as if the item is moving in the opposite direction of the dragging motion.
UNEXPECTED)

As a Windows Store developer:
* Sometimes you have multiple apps published.
* Sometimes you publish in multiple platforms.
* Sometimes you don't receive many app reviews.
It is hard to keep track of app reviews.
Adding RSS feeds will make easier to read our users feedback.
And sometimes, you want to reply to app reviews and keep in contact with users.

Can you please add an IAP which would have a recurring payment (automatically charge user monthly / annually / etc)?
Basically a subscription.
This would simplify development of apps which now need to prompt the user to go buy an IAP each time it expires and it also makes the experience better for users (who might be used to this model from Android / iOS)

Make AutoSuggestBox supports AutomationProperties for test automations and accessibility.

Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases.
It would be nice if you also ported the ads into UWP APIs so that they can be used with Desktop Bridge apps.
As of now, there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications.

For example, I search for "Star Wars"
The IMDb app is suggested.
I click on IMDb and it opens.
Now I must search again for "Star Wars" in IMDb.
IMDb should open to the "Star Wars" page directly from bing's search results.

Can You please provide any api in which we can get the details of hotspot whether it was turned on or Off

I've noticed that when you create a DataPackage containing both data provided directly (let's say text, using SetData) and delayed formats like a bitmap (using SetDataProvider), when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared.
I expect that the content set directly (the text) to persist after closing the application.

Currently it seems to be sorted by Unicode code points, which doesn't make any sense for Chinese characters at least.

The Idea is if user running our app and by any reason he rebooted the phone so in that case  once reboot happen there should be some event so that we can detect that phone is rebooted and we can handle our application accordingly

Windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and request.The conent consumers and content providers lack of interaction  makes it less exciting.
For eg :-
1) I wanted to request a particular app,game,movie and could not
2) i wanted to find the availability of a particular movie.
3) Infact I wanted a whole new movie category of jackie chan,bollywood,tollywood but could not find it.
4) i wanted to request cricket game but could not find appropriate place.
In short i am suggesting a community api where content users can interact with the content makers.
The content demand can also be actually measured with voting and popularity basis.I think it will be very good for the user requests or inputs to be heard for the providers .

Controls displaying the SIP when focused should provide a method to close the SIP to ensure data binding is applied.
Currently if the user clicks the "save" button right after using the SIP, the data entered is not persisted to the object bound to the control.

There should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review.
Apple has such a form, and on the few occasions that I've needed to use it, they've generally completed a review in a few hours.
This is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified, or where a trade show or other immovable deadline requires an app get through the review process more quickly than usual.
I found a similar suggestion made back in 2011, which was closed when the certification expectation time was lowered to three days.
Three days is not fast enough for many common scenarios.

It's nice that the MediaPlayer supports .webm videos, but for some reason these files are not considered as video library files, by which I mean if you register your app to open this extension and you also add the video library capability to your app, you would expect the neighboring files query to contain neighboring .webm files, but it does not.
Please can you add the .webm extension to the relavent list?
Also, can you do the analogous thing for .dds files but with the pictures library?

Microsoft / Pubcenter claims to have interstitials.
However, these are just bigger ad formats and not the interstitials we know from other ad networks.
Interstitials are displayed at a break point in the app / game.
Therefore it is for the app / game developer much more important to have a good fill rate.
Allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy.
(e.g.
he is able to show his own house ad when pubcenter can not fill the ad request).

Interaction.Behaviors and Windows Store Apps either need to work or not.
No BS in between.
Some work some don't and this makes it very difficult to architect app.

Mouse, sensors and other similar harware devices.
For user the sensors are the different places and ways to touch in space having X,Y,Z coordinates like:
(1) pressing
(1.1.)
power of pressing (Z is not less than Z1)
(1.2.)
time of pressing (T)
(2) pressing (Z is not less than Z1) and moving (changing coordinates in space +X, +Y, +Z)
(3) with one or many (A) finger(s) or with a (B) hand.
So ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user.
This is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to.

This would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device.
This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog, but being able, as a developer.
to add more colors to that list from your app.

should a have component that allows to show or view documents like Excel , powerPoint .. Thx

Add PrinterController that was in WPF and WinForms.

I want to add timer visually in visual studio like a textbox or ...

please send more information on app before removal of suspension.
I believe there is a process in place before removing or suspending an app.
- somebody spends sometime, testing it or checking required things.
I am asking whoever checks or tests it, put more information of their findings, rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like 1.1 or 3.6.
Which will help the developer to clear it quickly than spending time on finding what it could be wrong.
Please show positive attitude that, we need you developers.
Please do remember most of the developers are independent, you are the backbone for them.

In some data binding scenarios it's needed to hide pivot items (Visibility=Collapsed) when they are not needed at the moment.
However, collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree.
The header still 'exists' and is keyboard focus-able.
Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I'm considering this a bug.
Please fix it to support hiding PivotItems correctly especially during data binding when you can't simply add/remove it from the Items collection.

The SmartCard sample (https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/SmartCard) demonstrates how to define a friendly name for a virtual smart card when the virtual smart card is created (see RequestVirtualSmartCardCreationAsync in Scenario1_ProvisionTPM).
Unfortunately, neither the SmartCard class nor the SmartCardProvisioning class (nor any other related class) provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later.
A getter for this value should be added.

Add vertical orientation to the default text block for East Asian languages.

When searching in the market you should be able to open the app if already installed.

scenario: user picks file, app is closed, directory is deleted/renamed, next time: Dlg pickup file:

extended ability to highlight text or links within apps such as Facebook and Twitter for copy paste, individual text/word highlight of a text bubble with the WP7 txts.
improoved text edit cursor positioning, when highlighting text close to the top of the screeb or too far down, the scrolling plays up anf makes it awkward to get it right.

When a VPN is configured on a Windows Phone 8.1 device, non obvious badness will occur.
Even if it is not currently active it will intercept local network traffic and prevent some apps which are supposed to operate against a home network from working (UPnP, network shares, home media sharing, etc).
There is no way with the current SDK for a developer to detect this.
This leaves developers with only unappealing options:
1.
Suffer with negative ratings because of broken functionality with apps that worked under 8.0 or without a VPN.
2.
Prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the VPN is disabled before proceeding... including most users who have not enabled a VPN in the first place... and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched.
3.
Re-write large portions of code as native code and use the Winsock APIs instead of the WinRT.
The correct answer, is Microsoft to provide a supported mechanism so that a developer can detect if a VPN is enabled, and only then pop a message asking that it be turned off.

Please expand the MessageBoxButton option in Silverlight to include a Yes/No or Yes/No/Cancel option.
It would be nice to have a modal control that is standard between applications with additional user choices available.

WPF apps work much better when ngen'd.
Some apps have such poor startup perf that ngen is must.
Add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation.
Or since this is a "store app" will the standard background ngen work for WPF apps?

Add the ability to do memory profiling on background agent (periodic) as they are limited on memory and sometimes its too hard to catch memory leaks.

The Windows Store analytics API allows great access to acquisition data (both app and add-on acquisitions).
However, being able to tie this data with revenue data is limited as transaction data can only be downloaded by CSV through the Payout Summary page.
Accessing this information through an API would be useful for creating automated KPI reports.

Setting ProtextedText to On doesn't work, the selected text is still modifiable.
Example:
Editor.Document.Selection.CharacterFormat.ProtectedText = FormatEffect.On;
Editor is the value of x:Name given to RichEditBox element.

Add store uri schema like ms-windows-store://assoc/?AppExt=%q to search app extensions

"Hello.
Moldova is a country with over 3 mil people, located in Europe, good relation with US, EU and all neighbors, but the Windows store is not available, high internet coverage and quality, strong Windows dive community, etc.
We cannot download/pay for the apps, submit apps to the store.
Much smaller and isolated countries are having this possibility while Moldova is being ignored.
Looking forward for your considerations."

CharacterCasing has been added to the platform, but it seems to only be used on editable text controls.
I have been asking for this text tranform feature since the Windows Phone 7 Silverlight days, but even though most of the All Caps and All Lowercase text styles have been left behind in the Metro design days, there is still a need and wish to display labels, and other non-editable text content, in uppercase and lowercase styles, which exists in HTML with the TextTransform property in CSS.

There are few ads deployment options in Windows Phone for those who develop using Cordova.
There is a Cordova plugin with Admob for Windows Phone 8, but there is still no plugin AdControl and specific Mediation to Cordova.
Admob does not release Windows Phone 10 support and has no roadmap to do it.
Smaato has already supported W10, but there are not plugin developed yet.
My suggestion is that Microsoft create an Cordova AdControl and Mediation plugin.
This will help us bring our apps to Windows Phone and Windows Universal platform.

The File Explorer in Device Portal lets you look at .dat files (the ones where LocalSettings and RoamedSettings are stored), but there's no way to edit them.
Add a tool that lets you edit these.

Tester may fail an app even if its not on the certification requirement/ guideline
it may also be often the case that the tester don't understand functionalities of Windows Phone.
I have an experience and the the message for certification failure was
"The developer should be able to reproduce the crash by factory resetting their test device to remove any installed language packs and then launching the app in simplified Chinese prior to installing the pack.
If their test device is a Chinese market device and has the language pack installed by default, they will need to find and  use a different test device."
It was not stated anywhere in the certification requirement that a simplified Chinese app needs to be tested on device not from a Chinese market.
In my opinion, Chinese app are mainly design for Chinese and handsets are mostly from China Market.. Its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions.
In addition, neither were there guidelines on doing a factory reset on phones before testing.
Having said these, I propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the Windows Phone OS level when user switches language.
Neither were there guidelines on doing a factory reset on phones before testing.
Having said  these, i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone OS level would be good.

Please release compiler, SDK and tools for developing traditional desktop Windows API (and MFC, and .net) application on ARM Windows RT devices.

ShareLinkTask and ShareStatusTask should report error or information if the user doesn't have a social network.
Launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message.
If the launcher isn't possible, a property would be useful for disabling/enabling buttons that start the launchers.

Allow us to use runtime arguments for Windows.ApplicationModel.FullTrustProcessLauncher.LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync() in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest

When developing Coded UI test for a localized UWP apps, test becomes dependent on texts that are localized.
On most controls this can easily be handled by an AutomationId, but on the CoreWindow and MessageBox (incl.
buttons) you cannot set any AutomationIdxe2x80x99s so the coded UI test has the use the title to find the elements.
Please make support for setting set AutomationId on CoreWindows and MessageDialog!

It's good to have window.open (window object) references stored in browser session.
In browser session storage we do not have any mechanism to hold those references or even local storage cannot hold window object references.

Right now WinAppDriver only works on desktop.
Getting these capabilities across the Windows ecosystem would fulfill the promise of a unified Windows.
Making it possible for us to write tests, and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way.
So that in theory, our applications could report and find bugs for us.
Before our users find them.
Thanks in advance.
Looking forward to the progress you're doing :D

What happens to an account created by a developer using its Company's credentials (incl.
VAT) once he is out of the company and refuses to give any access details?
From a business security point of view there are some big faults with the current system as MS refuses to give any details to the Company if they are not using the login/email used for the creation of the account.

Native support of SVG animation with SMIL inside XAML for Beautiful and Responsive UI and Hardware acceleration backend on OpenGL/Direct3D/Vulkan/Metal.
The advantage of XAML to natively support SVG with SMIL is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations, the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver SVGs to you.
In addition to being able to search on the internet SVG animated icons ready to use.

If you set project target version to 1809 and you try to use this official example for launching feedback hub:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/monetize/launch-feedback-hub-from-your-app
It will crash the app.
Here is also full code example of this problem: https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArB5XyXKJ9ZWhjheAPPpeRA1rBWe
It's very problematic because now 1809 is available almost everyone and feedback hub launch link itself is broken in 1809.
I had to revert it to 1803 to get it working.

Today only SelectRange(ItemIndexRange itemIndexRange) exists in ListView to add new selection range to the current selection and SelectedRanges property is only { get; }.
Could you please add SelectRanges(IEnumerabel&lt;ItemIndexRange&gt; itemIndexRanges) to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make SelectedRanges property is only { get; set; } to be able to replace existing selection ranges

I've seen some suggestions that are close to what we need, but not quite, and are marked as completed.
I don't know why there is no support for current devices to read NFC cards/tags in full at a low level.
Seems deceptive to say that the device has NFC capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag.
For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare, UL, ULC,  Calypso, Desfire, maybe even more)
I've read that for WP8.1 the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific NFC chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices.
So please provide the low-level reading/writing functionality for NFC devices already in the field.

When I type a text message and need to go back to a different app (to copy a phone number to paste into the text message for example), I lose what I have typed when I come back to the text message editor, which is very frustrating.
Keeping the message as draft when exiting would save me the hassle of having to type it again...

I want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by DPE East Africa.
There is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like Windows Testing Devices.
Certain people request for devices and get immediately.
Unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality.
Any one here can see its down right nepotistic.
I launch this complaint  on behalf of others and in good faith.
Kindly i urge you to look at this matter.
Thanks in advance.

When uploading an app bundle of an Universal app to either the Window or Windows Phone store, the version is displayed as "2015.523...." instead of the version the developer set for the package.
This is very confusing and a question was asked several times in the forums (see https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d2913ad6-6130-45b6-8a7f-086ff7f04cff/problem-with-version-number?forum=wpsubmit)
Please comment and document this behavior

Seriously, while we see a LOT of improvement of ASP.Net/Razor languages, and even the C# language, reducing a LOT of verbosity in each version, with a lot of awesome new features, XAML got what in the last years?
{x:Bind}?
Seriously, to be honest we LOSE a lot of features with transition of WPF -&gt; UWP... DockPanels, Adorners, etc...
I think Microsoft needs OR boost XAML development OR, if it doesn't interest it, open source it then the community can itself improve it...

For 1803, I like that the backbutton is now built-in to the NavigationView control.
However, the placement of the button looks terrible next to the hamburger button.
I was actually excited to see it was built into the Nav control because i can't figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn;t look weird and out of place...  but, the built-in nav backbutton doesn't solve the problem either... it still look weird and extreme beta...

According to the documentation, it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.
According to the docs:
"For events, the target method must not be overloaded and must also:
- Match the signature of the event.
- OR have no parameters.
- OR have the same number of parameters of types that are assignable from the types of the event parameters."
When working with parameters, this works as long as the parameters have the default names.
So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event, the following signature works:
SelectedDatesChanged(CalendarView sender, CalendarViewSelectedDatesChangedEventArgs arg)
Now if you change the name of one of the parameters, as an example like this:
SelectedDatesChanged(CalendarView sender, CalendarViewSelectedDatesChangedEventArgs arguments)
Compilation of the Binding will fail because only default parameter names are assumed.
This behavior is not found in public documentation.
And honestly I would prefer to not have this limitation as it is totally counter intuitive.

Please add the possibility to add your own spell check service, or provide the data if a system wide one existed.

Replace Most Used Tags/attributes With Number.
For Example, if (you/we/a tool) replaces &lt;Div&gt; &lt;/Div&gt; with &lt;1&gt; &lt;/1&gt;,
1: page size will reduce
2: parsing time will reduce
developers build pages currently as they do, at the end before publish, they will use some tools to convert the tags to the equivalent number tags.
and when they select "View page source", browser will Convert them back.
for JS part, mostly should not be a problem, but overtime ....
all the developers needs to do, is some thing like this:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html NumberReplacement&gt;

As an app publisher in South Africa, I am currently unable to get any sort of proper tax invoice for purchases made through my developer account.
This makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant!
Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me?
Currently MS only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries (way to go in leading the way with technology in business!!)
Anyway, Im sure that Im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great.

bug description
============
using "send to compressed ZIP folder" with files &gt; 4GB outputs non-ISO-21320-1:2015-conforming files, which results in errors in many unzip softwares including 'unzip' reference implementation from info-zip.org as well as 7zip, libarchive, libzip and others.
solution
======
change 1 bit in ZIP64 files to better comply with ISO-21320-1:2015 and normative APPNOTES from PKWARE in order to interoperate with other unzip software.
'Total number of disks' shall be 1 - not 0.
referring to section 4.3.15 [Zip64 end of central directory locator] in https://www.pkware.com/documents/APPNOTE/APPNOTE-6.3.3.TXT
see also https://github.com/LuaDist/unzip/blob/master/process.c#L1277-L1280

It seems that there is a bug, which appeard after the last WP8.1 Update.
MediaCapture.InitializeAsync keeps throwing UnathorizedException.
I tested it on my previously (before the update) working example and MSDN sample.

currently only a defined set of extensions are supported for files to upload to SkyDrive using the new live API which limit really the usage of the API.
For example my app can export .CSV files and I had to rename their extensions to .TXT to be able to upload them to SkyDrive using the live API.

There is not enough control over the appearance of the Key Tip in UWP.
Specifically the height and width cannot be adjusted.
Consequently it is impossible to, for example, make the Key Tip be square the way it is in the MS Office applications.
The Key Tip is too tall to look good next to my controls.
We need a control template and/or better styling options for the Key Tip.

According to the documentation the proper way to handle input in a store app is to create a CoreIndependentInputSource from another thread by calling swapChainPanel.CreateCoreIndependentInputSource().
This gives you low latency input in case of a busy UI thread.
Once you create a CoreIndependentInputSource, touch visual feedback is visible again.
Even if you disabled it using
auto pointerVisualizationSettings = Windows::UI::Input::PointerVisualizationSettings::GetForCurrentView();
pointerVisualizationSettings-&gt;IsContactFeedbackEnabled = false;
pointerVisualizationSettings-&gt;IsBarrelButtonFeedbackEnabled = false;
It's not about aesthetics, Visualfeedback kills performance, the framerate in games drops by half, which is ironic if you think that's the kind of apps CoreIndependentInputSource was created for in the first place.
Devices with touch input are the ones that suffer the most from this bug since they come with weak GPUs.
Devs have to chose either low responsiveness or low performance.
CoreIndependentInputSource has it's own Dispatcher, does that mean it has it's own HWND/message queue?
Maybe that's the cause of the bug, PointerVisualizationSettings.GetForCurrentView() is tied to the main Window.
If you try to call "PointerVisualizationSettings.GetForCurrentView().IsContactFeedbackEnabled = false;" from the input thread it fails with an exception.
I got the _hWnd from CoreIndependentInputSource.Dispacher using the VS debug inspector and then called TryDisableWindowsVisualFeedback() as seen here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27550373/disable-touch-visual-feedback-on-windows-8-1-programmatically-desktop-app
The visual feedback was disabled!
However, live code has no access to that hWnd.
All helpful Win32 apis fail one way or another (GetActiveWindow(), GetProccessId(), EnumWindows(), etc).

It would be great to have the ability to hide all apps/categories in with Windows Store and only have it show the Private App store.
The sole purpose of us using the SFB is to limit what apps users can see and install.
So when they can see all the categories and apps in the store, it defeats the purpose.

PickSingleFileAsync and PickSaveFileAsync functions do not work on IOT they just return nothing.
Also phone has support but is painful to use, why is it different to the PC version?
Can it be made truly universal please.

I had unlucky case that my app was refused by the tester though on his screenshot you can see that he got exact message on why the app is not working as it required proper text to speech to be installed.
I believe that it is important that such testers and testing team can get feedback when its work is not proper so they can improve later.
I have contacted dev support and they told me that it is impossible right now and that I should post request here.

We would like to connect tablets via USB to RS232 or Bluetooth SPP profile with some industrial devices.

Preview it seems that the only way to use SerialPort if the app is written in windows forms or in WPF.
Metro style apps does not support SerialPort (at this moment?)

It is a common scenario for the user to initiate a network transfer, then turn off the screen or switch to another app while the transfer is still in progress.
Apps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response.
I'm aware that the Background Transfer Service is available, but there are cases where this is not usable, because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage.
This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience.
I completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness, but Windows Phone is currently too restrictive.

The UWP TreeView control lacks an event to notify that child nodes have been re-ordered due to a drag and drop.
The DragItemsCompleted event is fired but there is no direct information in the arguments about whether the child ordering has changed or whether a child has been added.

It's very simple, when i try to close a window with my Microsoft surface, the close button is too little for my fingers (I'm not the only one certainly...).
By the way, my finger's size is medium.
For exemple, the close button could be a top right triangle or larger cube.
best regards,

Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support.
Specifically, "excellent mouse support" means that menus will support all the hover actions that menus currently enjoy in win32 applications.
So if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu (without clicking), the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open.

We have several Instruments that implement an API via SOAP on Linux that presents as a WCF service.
Unfortunately, we can't create UWP apps because there is no support for the custom WCF binding - which is needed - to talk to these instruments.

We are an ISV who live in out of the United States.
When we want to set app price, Dev Center offers by US Dolloar for base price.
(Previous version of dev center was able to set by local currency.
This is degraded.)
USD is not familiar for us.
(We use different local currency basically.)
There is no conversion list between USD and local currency.
Microsoft sometimes changes conversion rate due to foreign exchange conversion rate.
Because of this, it is hard to find expected price by our local currency.
At least please provide app price conversion list between USD and local currency.
For example, 0.99 USD - 100 JPY
Conversion rate seems not constant, because of this it is hard to find our expected price.
For example,
Price tier 2: 0.99 USD - 100 JPY, almost 1$=101 JPY
Price tier 108: 5.49 USD - 518 JPY, this is 1$=94.35 JPY
Please provide current conversion list.
(Full list)
From price tier 1 to 194.
If we can set the app proce by local currency for base price, that will be the best.
Think of foreign developers!

When using the old style binding ({Binding}) of an Image.Source property to a view model property, the vm property can be either a string or a Uri (in additon to an actual image source), implicit conversion is done.
When using {x:Bind} it appears only strings are supported for implicit conversion.
Trying to bind to a Uri will either throw an exception or give a compiler error (I can't remember which) and certainly won't display an image.
Code analysis will often warn if you expose a properlty as a uri using a string type (can be ignored, but CA is giving a fair warning here I feel).
You can write your own converter for System.Uri to an image source type, but then you have to manually specify the converter on each binding plus you lose any (performance) tweaks MS may have made in their own converter.
I would like to see System.Uri supported natively by the runtime when making a binding like this.
Also, as a side note - the conversion from string breaks (throws an exception) if a bound string is null or empty - however a string that is non-empty and NOT a valid uri doesn't throw.
Seems inconsistent, and personally I would like the null/empty case to be ignored (clear any image shown, or ignore it if no image shown) as that's a very common case for VM's where the is no image assigned yet.


Hoello, with WP8.1 the Silverlight XAP apps are forced to use "Fast Resume".
This has broken my app Swipe Tunes as I hastilly submitted a WP8.1 update with Transparent Tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc.
Fast resume has pretty much killed my app and I can't delete the WP8.1 XAP from the store, and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the WP Store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers.
Please cant we have an option in the WPAppManifest file to untick "fast resume" and allow WP8.1 apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in WP8?

For apps that synchronize or connect to networks sporadically, it would be handy to have an easy way to detect if you are on a "cheap" connection, so if WiFi is connected or the device is connected to the web via USB.
The app could add options like xe2x80x9cAuto sync on start if on WiFi/USBxe2x80x9d.
Unfortunately Mangos new DeviceNetworkInformation class is too limited:
1.
It just checks if WiFi is enabled, not if you are really connected to a network
2.
NetworkInterface.NetworkInterfaceType is notorious to block for up to 60secs on some occasions, as reported in multiple internet forums.
So suggestion is to add properties like xe2x80x9cIsWiFiConnectedxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cIsCableConnectedxe2x80x9d to DeviceNetworkInformation, that execute fast.

Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change, which is fine.
But getting or setting the content doesn't work if the app is in background or unfocused.
(Access Denied)
This limitation results in a bad user experience, because there are scenarios, where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content.
Or the other way around; where one application creates data and sets the content automatically, and the user can directly use it inside another application.
So please remove this restriction.
If this is a privacy constraint, then please consider to add a capability, that can be declared in the app manifest.
Based on this, it also could notify the user at first app-start, like it is done with the camera access.
Thanks.

WinAppDriver does not work with @WindowsFindBy annotation because AppiumFieldDecorator forces the GET /context command, which is not supported by WinAppDriver.
I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching, so /context command is not provided.
However, the context switching is not required to support @WindowsFindBy annotated element.
It just needs the /context command that returns the current context name, which could be hard-coded as "NATIVE_APP".
Then Appium will happily use the native locator.

This is what the screen looks like:xc2xa0https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A
(sorry for the photo, could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!)
Looks good?
Yes, video and transport controls cover the entire media player!
Drawbacks?
In full screen, transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.
See https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwel93_Dvfege8VNw
Looks good?
No!
I want the transport controls' semi-transparent area to cover the entire bottom up to the edges, like in normal mode!
Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.xc2xa0Nevertheless, so far this is "ok" and could be called "as expected".
So far so good.
Now let's turn on DesiredBoundsMode.
What happens?
The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ
Looks good?
Page has no more safe area, BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area, even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.
(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before, so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?
!
That's an real issue.
I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.
And also in full screen I would expect transport controls to ignore safe area...
I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):
In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.
I found out that there is a &lt;grid&gt; element with x:name="ControlPanelGrid", and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of "48,0,48,27".
This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.
Removing the x:name or renaming that element is enough, the margin is gone.
Nevertheless, I would expect a less hacky solution.
Could Microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full-screen window only instead of manipulating a grid "by name"?
Having a safe-area within a media element's transport controls when not full-screen is definitely a bug.
And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack, since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it's name is not present.
Best regards,
Roland

Page &amp; content transitions are currently incomplete and a black box implementation not amenable to extension or customisation.
Please document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs.
For example, on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame's collection.
I then need to restore the previous transition stack on return to the initiating page in order for subsequent canned transitions to work.
The continuum transition for example will not animate correctly if it is the first transition on the stack.
At the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frame's stack from using the last transition to animate the page change.

The idea is simple: open a marketplace for developers only where devs can submit applications developed with an extended API, which allows to access to more information/capabilities on the device.
For instance, texts, contacts (read/write), sockets in listening, real multitasking, etc...
We know that you released a super-restricted API to avoid developing apps that could give inexpert users troubles.
But we (developers) can afford them and we can get a lot of benefits from this kind of apps.

Trackpad activities are not unified across different controls.
In webview, we can do panning by moving with 2 fingers and zooming by pinching, smooth and fluid.
However, we can't do the same thing in map control or in photos app.
It acts just like using a mousewheel with increment and it makes us feel awful.

I like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed, but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers, and could be solved with a few APIs.
A few improvements I suggest:
1) It is cool that the Facebook app can show my news feed in the people hub, but it's annoying the fact I have to go to the Facebook app to do something.
I suggest some APIs for the app to attach some "actions" or "commands" to the item, that the user can invoke straight from the people hub.
This way, the Facebook could the "like" and "share" commands, the Twitter app could add the "retweet" and "reply" buttons, etc.
2) Standard item types, that the People Hub can process, like the ability to view an image, or read a simple status update without the need to go to the app;
3) APIs to fetch other data associated with an item, like comments and counters (how many likes, retweets, etc.
).
As a developer, I think those APIs could exist.
I know those APIs are available to just a few selected developers (I couldn't find any information regarding them in MSDN), but I think (as a end user) those APIs could bring me a more immersive experience.

I want to create a app for incoming call recording but WP not provide any API for do this.
Also need API for voice record with background agent.

Hi!
Please implement style triggers for Windows Phone XAML (BAML?).
Sometimes they're much more useful than data binding (for example, when I need a StaticResource as a property value).

Unfortunately UWP is still missing a way to simply get a listing of fonts in the system, using C#.
Previously, before UWP, this was done via:
System.Windows.Media.Fonts.SystemFontFamilies
System.Windows.Media.Fonts.SystemTypefaces
It would also be useful to make a method to determine whether a particular font exists in the system (font specified by name or file name, and it should be able to tell us whether that font exists).
Or at least the ability to get the listing of fonts.

The MediaPlayer class can play Song objects, but there is currently no way to get at the song data.
Allow binary access would allow custom vizualizations, media players, and audio enabled games.
This would also solve another requested issue where devs want to get visualization data.
With access to the song binary, this data could just be created by the dev.

I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size (width, height) or position(x, y), but the values of those attribute are all zero.
I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree, or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree.
It would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that I don't have to guess and click through the tree to find an element.

Calling StorageFile.GetThumbnailAsync(ThumbnailMode.SingleItem, desiredSize) doesn't wait for the thumbnail to be generated.

Could you add the link for the feedback hub to the store's app review form?
I believe that the 'app review' and 'report for developers' should be divided.
Because - a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the Microsoft Store.
But, In fact, most of these posts should be handled with feedback hub.
By using feedback hub, we - app developers - can contact with the users to get know the detail and track the defects.
Is it possible to add the note to the review form as following?
"If you have a trouble for using this app or want to send a report to the app developer, please consider to post it to the feedback hub, instead of review.
Here is a link --&gt; [link] "

I have two versions of my app: one for Windows Phone 8.1 (v1.x.x.x) and another one for Windows 10 Mobile (v2.x.x.x).
Latter uses new features of Windows 10 and receives excellent reviews, but store mixes them with worse ratings from Windows Phone 8.1 users.
I think that app should have two ratings: one from Windows Phone 8.1 users visible to people having Windows Phone 8.1 and second one from Windows 10 Mobile users visible to Windows 10 users.

Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines.
Example:
    &lt;!-- Set TextBox Height to 10 lines (REQUESTED FEATURE)--&gt;
    &lt;TextBox HeightLines="10" AcceptsReturn="true"/&gt;
    &lt;!-- Set TextBox Height to 300 pixels (CURRENT ONLY PIXELS)--&gt;
   &lt;TextBox Height="300" AcceptsReturn="true"/&gt;
The reason why its a good idea to add a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML, setup the FontSize, FontFamily, and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly 10 lines.
Previously, this is messy because it requires setting from C# code, to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code.
My approach is 100% XAML and doesn't require messy calculations.
And it can be made 100% backwards compatible with Height property in Pixels.
When HeightLine = -1 then the height is set with Height Property.
When HeightLine != -1 then the height is calculated using HeightLine Property.
The default value for HeightLine can be set to "-1" by default to maintain backwards compatibility
Also, HeightLines &gt; 2 should automatically set "AcceptsReturn" property to "true" to make it super easy to create a multi-line textbox in XAML.
I also think there;s something a little bit weirld about the textbox control, if you specify 10 lines height it should say 10 lines in height and not expand box.... it should just beep when you get to the end of the 10 lines... of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the 10 lines...  but, i'll leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property... to make it work the way people want it to work....
(not everybody cares about drawing pixels on a paper and placing everything that way.... line numbers is enough for a control panel type setttings page...)

When a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed.
Upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too.
A small number of non-UWP desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern/UWP environment.
I'd like to see a way for any UWP app to opt-in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot.
Having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too.
It would allow the app/developer to track why the app was restarted but, more importantly, it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off--with the app running and at a specific position in the app.
I'm aware that there's some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and "sets" functionality which allows people to continue where they left off, but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the PC restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device.

Right now, you can not register them forever.
You should be able to get them automatically and of course get them from existing apps.
For example, the "PRO" extension stands usually for a better version of the same app from the SAME DEVELOPER.
But if someone else uses this, it is misleading.
I have a successful app in the store which someone else now released a version which looks very similar to mine (and is done very poorly, already bad rating).
It could be even done on purpose to get some of the success of the main app...
Since most of us don't have a trademark on app names, this should be forced by the store (everybody will benefit with this, Developers and Microsoft with a cleaner app store).

My suggestion/idea is to reduce the development time &amp; effort needed for ASP.NET web application.
To label the developer as .NET developer instead of windows developer or web application developer.
The idea is to segregate the User Interface and business logic, such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser/chrome as a standalone application.
Typical problem here would be deployment(Installation,update) of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file, It should not depend on reference libraries.
Some mechanism to compress and send this to users machine on request , once it reaches the client machine .
Dotnet Framework can uncompressed and open this application or User Interface.
This UI should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows10 task-bar which has the search box,thus removing the dependency on browser for web applications.
The downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in task-bar.
This UI application should have pure UI logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all OS (linux,windows 10 onwards).
Once this client part is done , we can have rest api's returning json data while maintaining session on server .
This new model of develpement can be used for both windows and web applciations.
With windows u have the UI app and the service app hosted locally , may be the IIS express used during local debug can be used.
So only differnce that makes it a windows application and web aplication is the url , if pointing to local its gonnabe windows standalone app elses its gone be web app.
Which shoudl be configurable.
This new approach of developing applicaitons simlifies the UI development , where developer get rid of learning other technologies like java script,angular,jquery,style sheets and all those n number of scripts.
Instead the developer should spent more on xaml designing making them depend on xaml tool, instead of learning JAVA SCRIPT is going to be huge shift and scuccess factor to beat all competitors like google event there chrome.
As soon this gets in to market due to the ease of development this should boom which eventually kill browser like chrome there angular concept thus again giving Microsoft a opportunity to beat others

and the user hover overs the seekbar, with mouse, or pen or any other input device for that perspective, wherver is the user mouse, show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position, just above the seekbar ( slider ) and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar, the thumbnail should update accordingly.

Hi!
As a long time WP7/8 and now W10M user, I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse.
With mouse, flyout opens on right click which is ok.
But when using touch gesture, I would expect behavior known from WP7/8 - flyout (aka context menu) should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item.
Instead in W10M it opens just when I release the finger.
This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.
In the end, developers have to use some workarounds to simulate old behavior.
You can see that even Apps list in W10M simulates old behavior instead of default one.
Context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen.

Could a Smart dial please be finally applied to the phone app?
It's quite frustrating to have to go into people, click of search and have to find contact, then dial.
Easy when you dont have lots of contacts, but when you are managing Thousands of contacts, it makes life easy.
Please implement.
Thanks.

There have been numerous major bugs and lack of features that are taking just too long to update.
If Windows Phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team.
Bugs like the "other storage" have been there too long and only get fixed in annual updates.
They should have been fixed days or weeks after discovery.
The delay not only has a impact on phone users, but also on the developers building the apps for the phone when the bugs and missing features impact the user's app experience.

When developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing Launchers and Choosers as Tasks to access certain data or perform an operation.
Currently this is only exposed for system-level data and operations.
It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.
Imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds.
Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.
It would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality.
Security is a concern and in this case that means access to data or performing undesired operations.
This can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app's tasking features.
Additionally, the app itself is responsible for what it exposes; and it would not be able to chain access to any other area - only data in its isolated storage space for functions that are allowed as tasks.
Lastly, app submission testing would ensure that the app "plays nicely" in what it offers.
Consider the following...
class MyAppChooser : Chooser
   public Choose()
      // give list of saved music or list of sites from news feeds
class MyAppLauncher : Launcher
   public Launch()
      // kick off app function such as PlayMusic() or ShowFeed()

The ability to have custom InkAnalysisDrawingKinds for which you supply your own model, and the ability to restrict which kinds of InkAnalysisDrawingKinds an InkAnalyzer can recognize.
The custom InkAnalysisDrawingKinds would be to allow me to recognize shapes aside from the default ones, and being able to restrict the list of drawings kinds would help me limit the types of drawings I am expecting.

As a developer, I'm always in the Dev Dashboard.
Despite being built to appear as a single-page app, clicking pretty much any link in Dev Dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page, to include navigation bars and columns.
This is very slow.
This behavior makes quick health checks and submissions nearly impossible.
I now avoid logging in until absolutely required.

When you publish an app in Dev Center it allows you to select the category (and subcategory) for the app to be placed into.
On both the mobile and desktop versions of the Store app you can browse these categories.
However, this feature is not present in the Store app on the Xbox.
Unless your app makes it into the Top Apps sections or Promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves.
If their app, like mine, is published solely to the Xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app.

In UWP XAML binding something that is NOT an ICommand to an event gives an exception in the XAML compiler WCM9999: Object Reference not set to an instance of an object.
Take any XAML page add a button to it and bind it to any normal, as in not a command, on the view model.
Compile the app and the Xaml compiler throws the exception.
I would expect it to catch this an give a readable error message about an invalid binding, idealy the propertyname and the control type at least.
Something that lets you investigate.

When the Unified Write Filter is running on a volume, where an excluded folder of exactly 5 characters is present in the root of the drive, the FltParseFileNameInformation fails miserably.
It parses the information by setting -&gt;Volume.Length to -&gt;Name.Length + 2, which must never happen.
Additionally, FltQueryFileNameInformation and FltPerformSynchronousIo cannot function on the file object, representing the particular folder.
The issue does not happen on subfolders and files, but only on the 5-character folder in the root of the protected drive, which is excluded.

Remove the 50 apps limit from the phone and 100 app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for an app with a search term.
If an app can not be found with its ideal keyword (becuase over a hundred apps already have used that search term) then new apps cannot be found with their ideal search terms.
The concept of paging using skip and take very easily resolves this issue.
It's quite dissapointing that a Bible app cannot be found with the search term bible.

If the device is connected to a network, speech recognition with local SRGS custom grammar, it behaves exactly as if it did not have the local grammar and starts to communicate to the "websockets.platform.bing.com:443" endpoint, increasing by tens of times the waiting-time for the result...
But if the device is disconnected from any network then the waiting time between "SpeechRecognizer StateChanged starts xe2x80x9cSoundEndedxe2x80x9d" and "the ResultGenerated event is invoked" is very small, less than 10ms!
it should always be this way, since the grammar is on the device.

I've been working on an LOB for my field of engineering (civil/structural).
The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.
And because the same app runs on tablets and PC's, our engineers can work in the field, come back to their office, and continue working with the same data on their PC's.
Because of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app, I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well.
All the saved and live data are saved on onedrive to allow roaming between the devices.
But I've found that windows phone 8.1 file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist.
This aspect alone prevents any adaptation of my app to the windows phone platform.
Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.
Also, please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt.
Otherwise, it's not a real universal app.

Hi, the existing Microsoft Advertising SDK for xaml is out of date, and designed for a long time.

I upgraded to the latest VS 2017 and change my UWP app to use .Net.Native 2.0.
It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.
An example is:

Calling this method would throw exception at runtime.
Please make sure the P/Invoke either points to a Windows API allowed in UWP applications, or a native DLL that is part of the package.
If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements, please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implications of using non-UWP APIs
--------
I don't call this function.
When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn't exist.
I have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I don't directly call.
I've reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.

Silverlight: https://www.reflectionit.nl/blog/2010/keyboard-selection-on-silverlight-listbox-and-combobox
I think this could also be useful for the toolkit.
I'm not sure if it should be a Behavior or an AttachedProperty.

Are not supported.

As an example say there is a ListBox.
The ListBox is full of ListBoxItems which each contain a TextBox.
The objective is to support copy/paste of ListBoxItems themselves.
However, because each TextBox within the list also has copy/paste, the Keyboard Accelerator is invoked whenever you copy/paste text in the TextBox itself.
This breaks the ability to copy/paste ListBoxItems and ScopeOwner is unable to help you in this case.
It seems TextBox does not use Keyboard Accelerators and therefore does not set Handled=true.
Therefore, in order to handle this situation you must add OriginalSource to the KeyboardAcceleratorInvokedEventArgs.
It is the only way to cleanly implement this case.
Otherwise, there is no way to determine where it is bubbling from and if the TextBox should handle the event.
To work around this I'm forced back to manually checking keyup/down events and OriginalSource is supported for those.

This would be a really cool feature to have for all Windows Form Factors, currently this is achieved either via COM on Windows, and on Android, however, the current implementations of those aren't very safe, because it provides unauthorised access across the System.
It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request), and that would allow the password manager, to fill password forms.
There would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work, such as specifying a Username textbox.
How this could work, is that developers of apps when creating a PasswordBox, have a property for a username textbox, where you could x:bind the Username TextBox to the PasswordBox.
There could also be a allowPasswordManager boolean on the PasswordBox, to disallow a Password Manager to access to the PasswordBox, or the app itself.
UI for the Password Manager could be inline or via Interactive Toast Notification.

Not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the VS list.
An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list, and select which ones are displayed.
Ideally, this tool would show the developer all of the WP emulators on the machine (can be scoped to only those emulators in the standard directory; bonus points if able to add other directories for custom images) and allow the developer to select/check off those emulators that she wants shown int he 'device/emulator' drop-down box within Visual Studio.
Particularly as the number of optional device images that developers can download and install increase, this becomes a more critical need to keep the Windows Phone development workspace clean.

At the moment, when launching the BingMapsTask it's only possible to set the center and zoom level.
There's no way to specifically highlight the paticular place that we're wanting to show to the user.
At best this is unclear, but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we're trying ot show them.
You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.
If the search finds nothing you get no pin.
Or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin (or pins) far from where you want them.
(Even half way round the world from where we wanted to show!)
It is possible to perform a search for the latitude and longitude of the place but this results in a pin that displays the latitude and longitude which can be confusing.
If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.
Even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing.

As a developer, I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.

It would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes.
The remittance countries as stated in the App Developer Agreement are the only countries where I sell my paid apps for this reason:
h. Taxes on App Transactions.
If you choose to have Microsoft make your app available for customers in the United States, any current member country of the European Union, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan or Liechtenstein (Remittance Countries), Microsoft (or its billing service provider) will collect and remit sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any, applicable to your app as made available in such country(s) through the Windows Store.
In any country other than the Remittance Countries, Microsoft will not remit any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other similar tax.
You are responsible for determining whether you have an obligation to register, collect, and remit taxes in any country other than the Remittance Countries, and you must designate the sales price of your app to include any applicable taxes that you are obligated to collect and pay in those countries.
For additional tax information and requirements please see MSDN.

Depending on hardware, you may hear gaps right after start or you may need load CPU with some additional work, like scrolling UI or running some work in background threads.

The recently released Windows 10 Preview SDK allows us to create "Publisherxe2x80x99s shared storage folder" that can be accessed by all apps on device from the same publisher.
Currently this folder can be created only locally.
It would be great to have the option for creating Publisherxe2x80x99s shared roaming folder as well.
Typical scenario - Game publisher releases three games for Windows 10 and the goal is to have an option for sharing Best score from all games in all those games across all devices.

Ask: At a minimum, add the list of Tag/Group tuples affected by the change.
Better still, surface the actual ToastNotification objects in the detail.
Reason: There's currently no API available for tracking the full lifecycle of toast notifications through Action Center.
ToastNotificationHistory only provides the current state, which even with polling/diffing doesn't provide the reason a notification was removed (expired?
queue too long?
user removed?).
Meanwhile, the background-task history trigger only provides a general "something changed", not the actual toasts affected.
This makes it extremely difficult for an app to maintain any in-app representation of notifications and synchronizing changed with the system (for example, to move notifications in-app when the app is running or to surface a longer history in-app).

Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions.
Currently, after 30 days of expiration, we can't renew with our original accounts.
I've asked the support, they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account, and after it, ask them to migrate apps and related data.
But he also said that NOT all of the data would be possible to transfer, like "reporting".
Well, the big deal for me is that I won't to create another account.
It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing, specially ones that you just had to create because some service does not allow things like a single renew.
After all, it is so easier to just allow to renew than you MS having to work for transfering data from one account to another.
I'm delaying the registration and app creation, untill it is possible.
I hope it will be!
Thanks.

An equivalent to airdrop so all those users using your platforms could send any file easily.
It should work over wifi ad-hoc (wifi direct), Bluetooth Ethernet zigbee or other.
Just imagine all all those apps on all devices could have a way to communicate with each other.
You could use this to make the win phone office remote app connect to the laptop without the need of a wifi hotspot.

Add drawingbrush and other missing drawing functionality from desktop xaml.

PrivateObject and PrivateType are missing in Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.UnitTestFramework

if audio file Api can give some frequency data, so that developers can create some creative frequency waveform (on UI) for their music player apps.

is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show, how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte).

This is really important, not only for menus &amp; toolbar buttons.
For example one thing I can't do right now is a simple search popup that would let me keep focus in where I'm searching, similar to how search in Cortana works.

Would allow binding to isvisible in an mvvm scenario.
Possibly some other property named parent to choose where popup is revealed from.
again suitable for mvvm.

I would like to control have my app control the vibration/haptic feedback setting.


Today I have run into a problem with ComboBox control.
The issue can be easily reproduced:
I have two rows and two columns.
Left column takes as much space as possible and I place the ComboBox into the right column.
I populate the ComboBox with a few items and run the app.
I maximize the window, open the ComboBox popup (selection menu), minimize and I see the popup moved to the middle of the window.

I would be convinient if the copyAndReplaceAsync method would return something similar to the copyAsync method.
Namely the file that was replaced.
It would make chaining additional operations much more easier!

With Windows 10 Mobile, UWP and Continuum Microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so I think bringing VS to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer.
I know it's not possible at the moment specially with all the hardware limitations but if you guys really are working on a surface phone, bringing visual studio to it will be so huge.
just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it, it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a 2.5kg laptop wherever he goes...

Sort of annoying to have to press attach three times to send three different pics.
Checkboxes maybe?

We need to print and see the output of mixed orientation and mixed size documents through WSDA (Windows Store Device App) driver.Please let us know the application list which supports page size with different orientation in Windows 10 Universal Apps.
Kindly let us know your feedback whether it is supported in any of the Universal apps or is it a limitation in Universal apps.
Thanks

If I have a TextBox (which is wide enough to have a delete button) inside a ScrollViewer, then clicking near the right-hand side of the text box (where the delete button would appear it had focus) fails to focus the text box (the delete button appears after the mouse down and then somehow interferes with the focus).
This does not happen if the text box is not inside a ScrollViewer.

Please add an Azure Developer VM for Windows with Unity.
Obviously the free SDK is a good start.
This would allow for remote builds and such.

I want this for Windows Phone:
    var item = await ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.TryGetItemAsync(fileName)
I would also accept StorageFile.IsAvailable for WP, too.

we can only add a mapicon one by one.
make possible to add a range of list&lt;mapicon&gt; to make it faster and optimized

With Universal Apps, the Windows Phone Dev Center will pull the Identity version number (and not allow us to change it in the store).
This version number is shown on the app's "details" page in the Windows Phone Store.
Visual Studio's Create Package wizard allows one to assign a version number, however, this assigns the Package version number.
This is not shown in the Dev Center.
Using this wizard alone, sets the Identity version number to a datestamp.
In addition, in the Windows Phone Store "history" page the app's Package number version is shown.
Please stay consistent.
Either use the Identity version throughout the Store and let us change that with the Visual Studio Wizard or ensure that the Dev Center reads the Package version (rather than Identity version).
Better still - make them the same thing!

I do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows.
I usually have to copy and paste data from a certain area and then paste into different areas.
If I can copy like say 4 - 10 different files/folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste, I would like to see a Paste - All, Paste select "which would have check boxes on each folder/file I have selected to copy.
That way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere.
I know it could be rediculouse if you selected a lot of files but make a limit and if you select all then all gets pasted no matter what the limit is...

I have published 2  UWP apps.
MS has abandon Windows Phone.
My apps are now Desktop only.
This was not my intension when starting development.
I am now forced to develop Xamarin versions of my apps with .Net Standard 2.0.
This will cost me much time and trouble.
There is no Window device/emulator with a form factor below 7".
If Window will never again support those small devices, it is sad but understandable.
But if Windows will support smaller devices
in the future, MS should support W10M at least for development of UWP apps in the mean time.The support of .Net Standard on W10M would be very helpful for me.
And I think for other developers and users of WP too.

Hallo zusammen,
ich verwende oft das Snipping Tool.
Um etwas Ausgeschnittenes nachher auszudrucken muss ich immer den Umweg xc3xbcber ein neues Worddokument-&gt;einfxc3xbcgen-&gt;drucken machen.
Gibt es einen Kurzbefehl um das Ausgeschnittene ohne diesen Umweg direkt zu drucken?
Oben in der Befehlsleiste kann man allerhand auswxc3xa4hlen, nur nicht "Drucken".
Wxc3xa4re es nicht mxc3xb6glich im Programm einen Button zu setzen, damit man das ausgeschnittene direkt drucken kann?

Add API to full control of Glance Screen

I tried the converted app using IME.
Microsoft IME and JustSystems ATOK work fine.
But Google IME launch failed as message is "Launch failed, please system reboot" on Creators Update.
Of course, Win32 Apps and UWP Apps can use Goggle IME.
We want to improve support Google IME.

Create a control for Continue in different device Like Continue Reading etc.
Microsoft wants us to build more connected app with Project Rome API.
So it would be nice to create controls to achieve Microsoft's vision easily.
For Reference
I like the way MSPoweruser app has implemented this feature.
In that app If we click Continue Reading button, it will show all the devices connected to this device.
So if I click on a device it will open the app on that device with the same artice.

WPF has lot of helper functionality for classes (Ex: Point, Matrix, Rect, Vector) and these are missing in UWP.
Ex: Point has vector extension.
Matrix class has scale, rotate, multiply functionality which is missing in UWP.
 bz of this we have spend time creating testing and maintaining this functionality our self, instead of spending time on implementation

We need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to PDF or XPS.
Presently the only way to do this is through the print UI (requires user interaction)

I've tried using WinRT/C++ Components and it's just a terrible experience.
One thing that will help is just get rid of the .idl requirement.
I don't think C++/CX needed anything like that.
And it's just a text file, VS doesn't even understand it, so we've gone backwards 20 years.
And I can't even get the VS template to compile, and that's just the simplest example.
Please rethink how WinRT Components are written.
Just have an annotation on public classes or something.
Something that's sensible and requires minimal extra work.
.IDL's were surely created by someone who just loves header files so much that they wanted to have more header files, but this time without being able to be parsed by VS.
It's just terrible design.

Follow touch enablement of mobile platforms and enable the list controls by default to have a "tap top" area that scrolls to top of list automatically.

It would be extremely helpful if the emulator could use webcams as camera emulation.
Otherwise AR scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices.
It has become even more needed with the addition of WXGA and the different scalings in WP8.

I've developed application which targets Windows Phone 8.0.
When XAP is deployed on Win10 Mobile device it has some strange bug.
After re-installing the app (uninstall - deploy) Application's Data stays the same - it isn't removed after unstalling the app.
But when I retarget the app to Windows Pone 8.1 problem disappears.
Could you please investigate that?

I currently have WP8 SDK installed and I am not able to get the emulator working consistently.
Only after repairing the installation will the emulator work.
If I close the emulator and try to run it again.
It fails with a uninformative message indicating deployment failed.

When I create a paid app with a trial option, many users blow right by it because it doesn't show up in the "free" category even though a light version of the app is free (via the trial).
Some people are resorting to the super-inefficient Apple  app store method of releasing 2 versions of the app... one that shows up in the "free" category and another that runs as a paid app.
The "trial" is a fantastic concept, but it is hobbled by this oversight

In 2017, .NET Native is still not mature and still has bugs.
But for UWP apps to be published in the App Store, you must use .NET Native.
Interestingly, Apps wrapped with Desktop Bridge do not have to use .NET Native.
So, please allow UWP apps without .NET Native!
(This would automatically enable us to write apps in F#, too, as a side effect).

The current Windows Phone Store certification guidelines mention that some policies exist for some countries, with China as an example, but this is not very useful compared to the old list which made every guideline explicit.
Please add the content policies back to the guidelines, i.e.
a list of country groups and the exact requirements that these countries impose on published apps.
For instance, China doesn't allow references to disputed regions... but what's a reference?
Is displaying a map centered on a completely different part of the world OK?
Many Arabic countries do not allow references to alcohol, but is there something else that's forbidden?
Can an app say "The alcohol-related features have been disabled because of country restriction", or does that count as an alcohol reference?
Thanks.

Currently, I am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods (in my case, those concerning Navigation).

Today only Windows Phone Store allows creation of beta and hidden apps.
The Windows Dev Center does not allow that.

Right now when displaying online web page in Windows 10 WebView the HSTS security feature is not working.
Also the WebView allows scripts from any source to load even though the page is loaded via HTTPS.
These are business critical security features that the WebView must support at least via opt-in or specific manifest settings.
Note both these features work in Edge, so I guess it's just a matter of making it available in WebView.
See these pages for testing HSTS and mixed content:

There has been some discussion on the blog post http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/30/universal-windows-apps-in-net.aspx?PageIndex=2#comments for supporting F# in the .Net native toolchain for UWP.
I had posted this on the VS uservoice site  https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/7542181-add-f-support-for-net-native but it looks like that was the wrong place to do that.
I hope the votes that request got will be considered for this.
A lot of people are moving to F# PCLs for library code and to be able to use those PCLs in the UWP and get native compilation via .Net native tools would be great.

GPU Programming, Game Programming Libraries, Cortana, Virtualization, DirectX

Be more like Google Play and less like Apple App Store.
Like most everyone, we have an app on Google Play and another on
Apple App store.
We absolutely love dealing with Google Play - it's easy to submit an app, their developer UI is so easy and straight forward, there's never any submission nonsense and the app shows up in a matter of hours -- not days -- after we submit it.
Apple on the other hand is generally nothing but headache.
You have to play their game and deal with their dev portal, provision devices, wait around for a lengthy review and finally wait for nearly a week at times to see an update make it out to your user-base.
Gah!
It's a headache.
In the end, the Windows app process is much too similar to Apple.
In some cases we've found it to be worse.
I'd like to see the Windows App store be similar to Google where I can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours, not days.

Microsoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you don't have to download a separate app , you update the stable one to the beta in the store.
In the android one to apply to the beta you do it using google plus I assume that microsoft can offer something like that using socl.

Inexplicably, the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly 10 years ago.
This panel is similar to a StackPanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down.
There are other panels in the UWP that do something similar, like the WrapGrid, but this doesnxe2x80x99t work well if the items are variable size.
And with the VariableSizedWrapGrid you must hardwire the column-span and row-span of each item to ensure everything fits.
One simple example where the WrapPanel is essential is when displaying a xe2x80x9ctag cloudxe2x80x9d.
The WrapGrid makes it possible to display a fully adaptable UI since as the container gets narrower on small screens everything can still be seen.
But it is not just for tag clouds.
The WrapPanel behavior is how items flow in HTML.
It is astounding to me that such a useful UI control xe2x80x93 one that Microsoft built years ago and with behavior that powers nearly every HTML page in existence xe2x80x93 was left out of the UWP.

Conjoining letters "Dwi" in Hindi is typed as 'xe0xa4xa6xe0xa5x8dxe0xa4xb5xe0xa4xbf' which is incorrect.

Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username/password authentication on the binding.

It is possible to open the emoji panel with keyboard shortcuts (Windows logo + .).
It would be nice to be able to open the panel from code as well.

Currently it is not possible to deploy an app to a device if you have multiple plugged in.
Connecting to the device will fail.
This means you must have exactly one plugged in for your deployment and testing to work.
I would like some way so that I can have my various devices (each with different form factor) get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing.
This would speed up the testing process and prevent the shuffling of phones on my desk I currently have to do.
Basically, replace "Device" next to the run button with the phone you will be deploying to or allow multiple connected devices to be selected.

It would be nice if Runs / Spans inside a Richtextblock / Textblock could support more formatting properties like CSS - i.e.
setting background color or a word, putting a border around a word, strikethrough, etc.
Currently it's difficult to do some of these things.
Nesting UIContainers inside of a RichTextBlock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text.

Calling StoreServicesFeedbackLauncher.LaunchAsync() in a UWP app now causes an unhandled Win32 exception if the target platform is set to Windows 10 version 1809.

When a developer opened a developer account, Microsoft doesn't issue business invoice for registration fee.
They said that use commerce.microsoft.com instead of formal invoice.
Have you ever seen the "invoice" in the commerce.microsoft.com?
If you do not yet, I highly recommend to open "show print version".
It is extremely poor "invoice", no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementary school student?
This is elementary school level invoice.
What kind of joking?

We have made a private test app and we use real money to test IAP.
This makes it hard to test when there is a $ cost to every test we perform.

This is currently not possible to test using CurrentAppSimulator.
Apple and Google also provide such a sandbox environment where IAP does not cost real money.

When Windows Phone 8 discovers an NFC tag, it only tries to act upon the first record.
If it does not recognize the record, or has no application to deal with it, it stops.
There is no message to the user indicating what is going on even.
The phone shakes and does its NFC tone, but then stops.
It would be great if the OS moved on to the second, third, etc, NFC record and tried to trigger off of them until there was a success.
This is limiting the potential uses of NFC tags on Windows Phone 8 and making cross platform solutions very near impossible to implement into a smooth experience.
We are trying to develop a cross platform dynamic NFC tag for the public's consumption, called the DTAG100 (www.dtag100.com).
We need for our applications on each of the mobile platforms to be able to read data on a separate NDEF records contained in an NDEF message.
Windows Phone 8 is falling short in this regard, because it unnecessarily forces the first tag to be Windows Phone 8 specific.
If anyone at Microsoft is able to assist we would be happy to get our hardware into your hands.
You could test NDEF message compositions not possible with standard static tags, and hopefully we could improve Windows Phone 8 NFC support.

I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas.
This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area.
At high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: "An unhandled win32 exception occured in &lt;app&gt; [17800]"
From my viewpoint, I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this.
There must be a bug some place in the framework.
This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed.
I'm guessing it's a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack.

The event arguments from the AddressChooserTask only returns the contact address as a string.
So if we need a specific part of the address we'd have to do some fairly tricky parsing.
It would be nice if we had finer access so we could specifically get, say, the postcode.
When entering address details for a contact the address details are split into different fields anyway so one would expect to be able to access them individually from the result an AddressChooserTask as well.

Today it's not possible to create a virtual space where an ARCore device sees what the HoloLens user does.

I have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).
It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk.
The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.
It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.
Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.
And a user will just go elsewhere to get the app and end up downloading from shady app from the web causing them to get viruses as you won't allow elevated apps in the store.
So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.

Add a custom CalendarView control with more personalization options than the one included in the SDK.
List of features:
 - Individual CalendarMonthView control, so that if you want to display standalone months, you can (maybe you display a grid of 4 months, etc)
 - CalendarView control that consumes the CalendarMonthView
 - CalendarView supports swiping up/down to switch months
 - CalendarView supports arrows that appear when hovered allowing mouse users to switch months
 - CalendarView supports mouse scroll to switch months
- CalendarView supports adding buttons/elements that stay fixed while scrolling (like a Go To Today button)
- CalendarMonthView allows custom headers/UI elements to be added
- CalendarMonthView allows overriding the weekday headers
- CalendarMonthView allows overriding content in the days, including changing the position of where the day number is displayed, etc
- All those CalendarMonthView options can be configured somehow from the CalendarView
- range selection
The GitHub issue can be found here: https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/560

Please add ability to "Remove Azure AD association".

Here are some more things I would appreciate:
- It would be cool to be able to remote-execute sripts and programms and for examle also set a schedule for z.B.
execution on every restart.
- Also support for "multi-installation" of apps.
- desktop remote (direct rdp or something)
- the scaling of the website sometimes doesn't work.
text and parts of  graphs are not wisible because it disappears below.
you can't scroll at that point.
- shortcut to bring up the remote computer manager
- LAN networking options
- I don't know if it is only me but I can't kill a "running process", but i can stop a "running app"
- event manager
being able to execute programms

An api to let us create us create a screen recording app.

Windows Phone 8 includes a new Map control.
It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names.
Street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center.
To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in it's constructor.
But Route object does not have public constructor.
The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class.
This is  a problem!
RouteQuery uses online service to calculate the route.
Apps can't show the traveled route at real time on the map (like jogging apps).
Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently.
It is possible to workaround this with MapPolyline.
But the polyline is shown OVER the street names.
Street names color stays black and not being centered.
Also if the new Map has route feature it should be usable.
Possible solution: Route class implements IRoutePath.
MapRoute constructor should accept IRoutePath inteface instead of Route class.

Need capture all the http request or resource request, such as : http request in js, css, image resouces filexe2x80xa6
http request includes get or post request(url and body)
While android and ios can do it.
UWP need it.
Thanks,

Currently the incredible specimen of humans that are reviewing apps get it wrong, often.
There is no way to discuss with anyone about the app and rectify any certification issues or misconceptions the reviewer may have.
Also with policy, there are instances where a developer believes they adhere to policy yet no one is able to discuss the policy breach with the developer and instead they just ban the dev .
This is even after the dev emailing as directed etc with no response.
This experience should be improved, so its less like a tick and flick process or sausage factory like.....devs obviously have a brain and its usually good to speak to someone who at least has an idea which way is up.....

At the moment a VSTO add-in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store.
An idea could be extending Desktop App Converterxc2xa0tool in order to manage VSTOxc2xa0add-in.
Another solution could be simply extend Office Store in order to publish VSTO add-in.

I would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side, so when left handed people scroll, they could also see the content.

I have been struggling to upload files from WebView since last few days and there is no progress.
Everything works well, The button is visible and it says "Choose File", however if you click the button nothing happens.
can anyone with WindowsPhone knowledge help me?
Its an XAML WebView app not silverlight app.
Please vote here to enable photo upload option in webview apps for windows phone

If someone Browses the Phone Store with the APP everything looks ok, but if someone Browses the Phone Store via the Webpage they see the APP description and the APP Changes like one element.
should be changed

There is a bug in multicast .beginJoinGroup.
After tombstoning if this method is called in onActivated or any "load" then thread is blocked.
Solution is to call this method in an override of onNavigated method.
Plz fix this.

The language should be a search critreria for apps and games.
The non-english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and it is hard to find apps in my native language.

If NavigationService.Navigate() would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI, it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows.
I know we can pass string in the URI but come on we are creating native apps not web apps that we should be limited to this way of coding.
Thanks!

I need reports for bussines class apps.
Rdlc report viewer with report designer (in winform apps) was the easiest way to get the job done.

The Backgroundtasks can currently be launched every 15 minutes by the TimeTrigger.
Unfortunately if a task is launched via this TimeTrigger, but appears idle to the Operating System, then it is SUSPENDED.
This means the task can not execute for the full 15 minute window.
If you either leave Idle tasks alone (they are Idle, so not using system resources right?
Leave them alone!)
or allow 10 minute or maybe even 5 minute TimeTriggers to be used.
My current Backgroundtask has a timer in it, which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically, do some processing then wait again.
This low amount of processing looks to be Idle so gets suspended.
Does not make sense that an Idle task would be suspended for not being busy enough.
Making the task more busy (to work around idle tasks being suspended) would mean more battery usage, kind of the opposite of what you want.

You may wish to consider my FlipPdfViewerControl for inclusion in the toolkit.
It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.
I have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement.

I want to use FileSystemWatcher in uwp.

Read/write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles (based on week-days, time, position, etc).

Currently, Entry field in Xamarin.Forms provides no functionality to prevent soft keyboard from showing up entirely.
There are solution out there that will hide it but they make things even worse since now you have keyboard popping up briefly, then disappearing from the screen.
It feels like having a way to disable keyboard from showing up entirely on an Entry field makes sense.
For example, I make my own buttons, that resemble keyboard.
Tapping on each of these, puts some characters in the Entry field without showing keyboard but only when Entry field receives focus.
Another example, scanning with external barcode scanners into a field when it has focus only.
Here also makes no sense to show keyboard.

It would be nice and a really big security improvement if Windows 10 could natively support DNS over TLS.
Nice implementation of this feature is in the latest Android 9 Pie, where you can add your custom DNS resolvers and enforce DNS over TLS, or you can keep automatic configuration of resolvers (from DHCP) and use DNS over TLS if the automatically obtained resolvers supports it, otherwise use insecure (standard/plain) DNS.

In Windows 10 (Messages for example) there is a very nice control for entering/selecting contacts to send an email or text message etc to.
The control would allow for the use of the contact picker, but allows for manual entry and deletion of contacts.
The control would include a field for required ContactFieldTypes.
This sort of control should be pretty much a standard across all UWP apps to maximize a consistent user experience.

Up until the latest windows update, the virtual keyboard worked fine, but now (using my app with the most recent nuget packages) in assigned access mode (tablet mode) the keyboard closes when tapping a different inputbox on a xaml form.
To get the keyboard to return, you have to tap it again, and this happens on every single box.
It didn't do this before the latest update.
I'm using a tablet with Win 10 Pro build 1709

Currently the pricing, trial mode existence and market distributions are common for all XAPs.
This leads to a major problem in many content based apps that are based of in-app purchases.
I have developed a WP8 app that contains in-app purchase items.
I want this app to be free and users will pay for the items.
Since WP7 does not support in-app purchases I have implemented separate XAP that contains a bunch of these items and this version should be a paid app.
But this cannot be done because individual pricing between XAPs is impossible.
Also I would offer trial mode for WP7 XAP, but also this selection is common for all XAPs.
To overcome this, I would need to make totally different app for WP7 with different GUID.
But as a result WP8 users would see two different versions of the app in the Store since all WP7 apps are visible there and you cannot do anything for that.
So some WP8 users would buy the WP7 version of the app although the WP8 version would be better.
So currently I cannot release this app for WP7 at all to not confuse the main audience (WP8 users) with many versions.
Please add the possibility the set price (&amp; market distribution) and trial mode existence individually for the XAPs.

Add WebP support, so I can easily process and export images using the format.

When entering a payment method, there's no option to delete an existing payment method before entering a new one.
This is a problem when credit cards constantly fail authorization.

When a notification implements the `hint-people` attribute to trigger the notification badge in My People, then there will be no Toast notification but an My People Notification (these little, animated things)
How about letting the user decide, whether My People should use these animated notifications or normal Toasts.

Make TShell available to all developers, not only OEM manufacturers.
On other platforms (iPhone, Android) such tools as TShell a readily available to all developers.
Opening TShell to developers will provide them with more tools to debug hard bugs, understand platforms and develop new tools to make development for WP easier.

Our company develops system-wide accessibility apps, we just ported our app from Windows to Android which is selling in the thousands.
We'd like to create something similar for windows phone using an equivalent of Android's AccessibilityService and UIAutomation for Windows.
It's a shame this framework hadn't been ported to the phone version of windows 10, we have customers who own thousands of windows phones who are considering swapping them out for android now..!

Most of my working data lives on C:Usersmy-name folder so I want to navigate to it as quick as possible.
I believe many Linux users love the `~` or `/` path.
For example, when I want to go to my user path, just Ctrl + R, enter ~, then press Enter.
Or want to go to System drive path, currently, I press Windows key, enter C:, then press enter.
It's good but / is save me less time than C:
Thank you!

Do you think that you could make the Windows Store, and other built-in-apps accessible from the device portal, making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings, etc.

Saw the talk given by Roberth on a new ApplicationWindow API that allows for some very nice windowing scenarios.
However, the API never made it out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=132&amp;v=hZU0HDTI-zs

Enable Linux devices to be included in a userxe2x80x99s device graph - to enable discovery, launching of apps, and communication between connected devices

Allow apps to act as data sources for other apps.
Build on WCF to allow on-phone app-to-app communication.
This is something that Apple just announced and Google is expected to soon.
Get this working ASAP so Windows Phone doesn't get left behind.
Allow JSON and/or XML to pass data between apps.
Use a URI to query apps, ie:
facebook://Friends?DateOfBirth=DateTime.Now.Date
Most importantly!
Make apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app, then let it happen in the background.
I shouldn't have to launch Facebook just to get to the data.

Windows should allow users to freely redirect media (Audio, MIDI even Video someday, I guess) from/to the Hardware(audio interface, webcam, etc) and/or Applications (even considering "The Desktop" as a video+audio media generator).
Any media (Audio/MIDI/Video) generator/consumer (be it an app or an hardware device) should be treated as a freely connectable node, instead of an hardwired starting/ending point, like today.
This would allow the user, through the OS, to "detach" an App media output from its default interface (audio/midi card, screen/window) and "re-attach" it to another App (or device) input.
An example of this "An application as a node in an internal media network" would be something along the lines of AudioBus for iOS.
It could be as simplistic as allowing piping Apps/Devices outputs into Apps/Devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a "piping" routing manager GUI.
loopMIDI is also an example of this, in the MIDI realm, allowing on-the-fly creation/destruction/renaming of virtual MIDI ports, although lacking the routing/filtering layer, which MIDI-OX's (primitive GUI) routing+filtering is a good example of.
Extrapolate the above capabilities to Audio, allowing on-the-fly add/remove interconnectable/reroutable audio nodes (virtual interface devices) to which Apps/Devices would attach to, instead of attaching only to hardware interfaces.
Some of the above is already possible today (there's some Virtual-Audio-Cable solutions) but it's cumbersome, non-standard and definetely not done (optimized?)
at an OS level.
Same for video, not only making (desktop/window) screen capture a breeze and naturally handle by the OS, it would also allow the creation of virtual screens (resource permitting of course, for desktop expansion/mirroring) outputting them to a video input/recording apps, USB3 or even to a DLNA receiver screens.
All the above is also somewhat possible today, but there's no OS based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user.

I often fiddle with the price of the In-App Purchase(IAP) in my WP app, to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and #of purchases.
At present I have to manually record when I change the price, as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal, which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported Excel file.
Ideally I would like to see a graph with both #of purchases and purchase price plotted against time, this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase vs price.

Right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom.
We can also change lock screen background.
However it would be useful to get more flexibility.
We could show users some constant notifications on lock screen - similar to Android lock screen notifications, it's really great feature that I use a lot and miss it on Windows.
Right now to show custom content we have to set our own background and render some xaml on it, which is memory consuming and requires a lot of work.
If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications, it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.

it is similar like this issue : http://www.dcfever.com/cameras/specification.php?id=1620
We've inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal.
If Windows set to 125% DPI and when slider value is the same as its maximum value.
Our App would crash.

Premier Enterprise customers who use Dev Center to publish LOB enterprise apps on their Private store have an erratic support experience.
When submitting a ticket it does not allow them to use their Enterprise IDs to submit a ticket, so a dev center admin with a enterprise id @contso.com is not able to login and dev center forces to choose a personal account originally linked to Dev center to submit an incident.
This needs to be changed so Enterprise customers can open a support incident

We would like to be able to show end users the recommended version of the OS, not just the minimum.
This would allow them to know that additional, awesome features are there.
For example, the minimum requirements: Operating system: Windows 8 or later required
Recommended: Operating system: Windows 10 version 14393 or later

I'm developing a Windows 8.1 App that uses the Windows.Data.PDF API.
My PDF files were created with Adobe Acrobat XI and are password protected.
On implementing PdfDocument.LoadFromFileAsync I receive an unspecified error.
After some diagnosis, I found that if the PDF is saved in an earlier Adobe Acrobat format than version X, the program works fine.
Could it be something to do with AES 256 Encryption that the later acrobat versions use?
Is this a bug in the PDF API?

I'd like to see an API to create virtual MIDI ports built into Windows.
The Surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a MIDI controller, but this currently requires installing a 3rd party driver, which is not a great end user experience.
Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too, but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports.

When UWP app has a Splash Screen with transparent background color declared in the app manifest, desktop renders the accent color while phone renders the background color.
It does not make sense.

From WinRT to UWP, my xaml-generated pdf is not rendering the same.
See below the template of my button and the two different renderings.
Correct in pages and designer but not when printing it to a pdf.
Code: http://s3.postimg.org/cttm2rmjn/buttons_code.png
In-app (classic page): http://s3.postimg.org/y27ak710j/buttons_ok.png
Xaml pdf printing: http://s3.postimg.org/52cw47ieb/buttons_nok_pdf.png
Other strange differences did show up as well - especially in Grids - but the example above is the craziest one.
Please tell me if you want some details about other mismatches.

Hello,

What if we miss a call or incoming text.
This should be added as an update.
Give us the option to set reminder tones for these.
Let us set intervals like 2 minutes et cetera.

The low-end phone with less storage but with the SD are really diffused, but the limit of the data that can't be stored in SD is awful.
With the app on SD the device can be better ;)

Can we know the platform on which app was purchased after app linking?

It's great that the Dev Center now allows multiple users to access the same account, and I can submit app packages as a user with the developer role: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt489008.aspx.
However, it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in Visual Studio.
At the moment, it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his Microsoft account just to create app packages.

Right now, if you single press the Search button inside an app (or anywhere else in the phone), Cortana is launched muted while with a double tap Cortana is launched waiting to here the user speaking.
I think that a wise addition would be to create a "Universal" search platform that when enabled, a single tap on the Search button will bring up only a search bar and with that, the user would search for content inside the app (and by "content" I'm talking specifically for app content).

On Windows 10 Mobile, for mobile connections, calling getSignalBars on a mobile connection always returns 5, even if the bars displayed by the system are any other value.
It's working on Wifi connection and on both type of connections on Windows 8.1.
Is this a bug or something changed in W10M ?

I love one note because of its fast cross platform sync, i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes, adding a button in the dialer (Loudspeaker, mute, hold, add call.. ) to open OneNote will help me open it easily.
When it is opened from a call, then OneNote can get information on the call details (Person who is on call, time etc) which would enable easier understanding.
Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera, Messaging etc

Additional Payment option such as paypal should be added to allow people who owns visa card with advance features t register for Dev Center.

I have a scenario, when my user wants to sign into two different accounts.
Unfortunately, the API does not support that (e.g.
it logs off account 1 when logging into account 2).

This is a Helper to ensure Safe handling of Content Dialogs, This will help prevent exceptions from trying to open a Content Dialog, when one is already open.
Methods involve Async and Non Async opening (If you want the result or not), These methods have a Boolean that lets you specify whether you want to wait for the Dialog before it to close before showing it, so you can show break through Dialogs, such as Error or Password Prompts.
As well as a return Method, that allows you to return to the Dialog before it, after the new Dialog has run, such as if you want a returning Password Entry, or something.
Methods:
Task&lt;ContentDialogResult&gt; CreateContentDialogAsync(this ContentDialog Dialog, bool WaitPrevious);
void CreateContentDialog(this ContentDialog Dialog, bool WaitPrevious);
Task&lt;ContentDialog&gt; BreakThroughReturnAsync(this ContentDialog Dialog, ContentDialog ReturnDialog);
void BreakThroughReturn(this ContentDialog Dialog, ContentDialog ReturnDialog);
Properties:
public static ContentDialog ActiveDialog;
I'm considering rewriting it as a Queue for Dialogs, as currently it will only display one Dialog, and queue one dialog, meaning if you try to queue two it will fail.

I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit.
I just my dev center account just like facebook and watch for notifications.

Currently I have to do a request to the server to check the certificates, extract the public Key and verify it's ok.
Currently I cannot access the handshake of the HttpClient where the SSL pinning verification should be done.
I know I can get server certificates from the server once the request is done, but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the SAME request.

Scenario:
    In an XAML page, there are some buttons and command bar buttons, both of which have access keys set.
Problem:
    When user invoke the access key of a button to navigate out, the AccessKeyDisplayDismissed event of the command bar button isn't invoked.
Influence:
    When the user pressed the access key of a button to navigate out, the tooltips of command bar buttons stay where they are.

According to your registration portal, people form some countries are not allowed to sell apps or use the advertising service for Microsoft.
Since Ixe2x80x99m from Lebanon, Ixe2x80x99m not allowed to SELL my apps or to use the advertising service for Microsoft, but THANKS you allowed me to register and pay the $99 fees annually and to help you increase your AppStore apps.
I have lots of ideas and prefinished apps, but I hold the dev.
because Ixe2x80x99m from your banned country list.
This is not fair, I have to pay as any other pay and I have to develop as any other ppl do, but at the end I have to publish my app for free and even not allowed to put advertisement.
You have to reconsider your rules and to include more countries, I have no idea why Lebanese ppl are not allowed to sell apps, or any other banned country.
Thanks

Give a UI to manage Manifest file changes, similar to how project properties of changed.

The latest OS update to the HoloLens 17134 is missing key features for the Commercial Suite, such as Kiosk Mode and others.

Please upgrade the YouTube App by Microsoft Corp. with Metro UI instead directing to a mobile site.

In some case if enterprise wants its signed app to be installed using In house Touch Kiosk(PC/MACHINE) then this should be possible using USB installation.


As a developer that has to stay on top of feedback, I receive feedback from users around the world.
Some of these users are dirtbags and send me garbage feedback like "asdfasdfasdf".
I cannot delete this feedback.
This clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times.
I contacted support and they can't delete it either SRX1428283722ID

We need more control over the device so childrens activities can be regulated.
I thought about something like the MDM is doing with exchange server and its policies or the "My Family" feature but for third party apps.

The TreeView (from Windows Update 1803) lacks the possibility to select a ceirtain TreeViewNode from code.
For example an "IsSelected" property could be added to a TreeViewNode or a function like selectNode(TreeViewNode) to the TreeView.

Microsoft Visual C# 2010
Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Tools 7.1 (Beta) - ENU
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate - ENU Service Pack 1.

You could rename the Windows 10 Mobile to Windows 10 Watch and you could stop making the Lumia mobile phones but you could start making Lumia Smartwatch with Windows 10 Watch

Hello,
it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume.
I know you have tweaked alarm volume in Insider builds, but you simply cannot cover all user need if you don't provide them the slider.
Many users still complains about given volume, even fade in doesn't save the situation.
The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification.
User might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day.
That would make all the users happy :)
Thanks!

DNS-SD _services._dns-sd._udp.local.
(find all service types) does not work.
I am using Microsoft's DNS-SD which aims to implement the Zeroconf standard RFC 6763. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763
I got nearly everything working, except the case of finding all service types on the network using the service type "_services._dns-sd._udp" on the local domain.
This is really useful for making debugging tools, such as making a Service Discovery browser.
I get no results when I try plugging "_services._dns-sd._udp."
(or "_services._dns-sd._udp") as the System.Devices.Dnsd.ServiceName in the aqsQueryString.
You can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the RFC.
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1337/_index.html
For comparison, I've tested this on Bonjour, Avahi, and Android's Network Service Discovery, and they all handle this case correctly.
First, is there any way to get this to work?
(Perhaps I need a change to the aqsQueryString?)
Second, if not, is there somebody to report this bug to, so this can be fixed?
Third, is there a different way I can get the list of available service types through a different means as a workaround?
I'm using the Microsoft example found here:
https://github.com/stammen/dnssd-uwp
I filed this issue there (https://github.com/stammen/dnssd-uwp/issues/8), but was told I should try posting here.

Our (potential) application has a shared backend library system that relies on opening files via fopen (it's cross platform).
However, as the FilePicker only returns StorageItems, this isn't possible.
The only workaround we have is to copy the file into a temporary folder, and get the path from there.
Unfortunately this means the app is a none-starter, because the files can be several gigabytes in size, so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file.

SL5 (as well as WPF) support setting the Value of a Style Setter to a Binding but XAML Windows Store apps do not (maybe because it was based on a snapshot of SL4).

Add opacity per layer to dynamically adjust layer opacity (say with a slider) if tiles have been previously loaded and viewed.
The WP7 map control lets one adjust layer Opacity.

HLS becomes more and more popular to stream live video contents on  mobile devices.
Is there any plan to support this protocol in WP?
If not, what is the recommended solution.

It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.
So it could stick with the same 4 row limit but could allow for wrapping so if there were 7 items, the applicationbar would expand to allow for the 2nd row of icons.
It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page, so you could specify one at the top, left, bottom or right.
The bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes.

Allow background services to display controls on top of other applications.
It would be great to, for example, play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app.

Internet explorer keeps running in background and is always visible while back button is kept pressed.
That is good for multitasking and it resumes the work from where we left but still if I have done using it, I can't close it down.
That is irritating actually.
An exit button should be there on all application software's.

The ListBox and MultiSelectList destroys and creates controls while scrolling up and down.
However, when using a long list of Checkboxes within one of those lists, it randomly checks different checkboxes while scrolling.

Bring WebView with Edge to WPF and WinForms applications

Many mobile applications are written in java.
It would be nice if wp7
supports this.

I hear a lot about xe2x80x9cclean uninstallxe2x80x9d but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind.
Specifically, persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind, potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state.
See the data piling up in the following stores:

After my application open office document programmatically in background, link to it appears in Quick Access Area in File Explorer.
It's not good thing, because it's not needed to share this with users.
In this case, we need functionality to remove item from that area programmatically.
So, will be extra cool to have smth like RemoveItem(string "ItemName"); that will remove it from Quick Access in File Explorer.
Thanks!
p.s.
I thought, that this is same as at:
"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/7874598-api-access-for-quick-access-area-in-file-explorer&amp;quot;
but there Clint Rutkas (Admin, Windows Developer) told to create a separate UserVoice request for this.

Right now, Voice Commands registered for an app only work when an app is off, or in the background.
They do not work if you are in the application already, and use Speech from the Windows key to navigate somewhere else in the app.
To the end user, it appears that the command is recognized and the system is taking you there, then it closes without actually doing anything.
This appears to the end user like a bug in my application, not a system-wide OS bug.
I understand this was not necessarily the designed use case, but consider that the search button takes you back to the main Bing search page, no matter what part of the Bing app you are in... the hardware buttons need to work consistently for the sake of the end user, even in use-cases you didn't originally intend.

A DNS-SD service registration does not respond to mDNS queries having a class of "ANY", but only responds to queries having a class of "IN".
Example code which registers a service using Windows' DNS-SD APIs:
var service = new DnssdServiceInstance(...);
using (var socket = new StreamSocketListener())
    var registration = await service.RegisterStreamSocketListenerAsync(socket);
    // Do stuff now that the service is registered.
You can use Wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of "ANY" will be answered by a DNS-SD registration from Bonjour but will not be answered by the above DNS-SD registration.

Enable iOS devices to be included in a userxe2x80x99s device graph - to enable discovery, launching of apps, and communication between connected devices

Currently, Windows Phone is still very much a .NET platform unless you want to do games.
However, many devs (most of iOS developers) are used to create native apps for many reasons (performance, existing code, advanced memory management, etc.).
Although Microsoft has added support for native code in WP8, most of the APIs are not available to native developers.
Either one has to use .NET to access a library or Microsoft advises to do a .NET app with native code in a WinRT component.
However, that's exactly not what I want to do any many other devs think so too.
We want native apps that can do everything .NET developers can do.
Don't limit us artifically just because you don't like native developers.

UDP Broadcast (send to 255.255.255.255) is not supported.
In this case an exception is thrown.
We need UPD broadcast to search for our devices in the network.
These devices have a simple network interface an cannot be extended for several reasons (flash size, communication library).
UPNP and UDP Multicast is not supported by these devices.
The only possibility to search them is to use UDP Broadcast.
We get an answer back and know how devices are in the network.
Then we can use the Smartphone as remote control four our devices.

Allow to mix two app models (JavaScript+WinJS+HTML5 and C#+XAML) inside one application.
Some problems are better to solve with JavaScript+WinJS+HTML5 and some other with C#.

Allow to register Background Tasks to be registered when die App is first installed from store or side-loaded without having the need to start the app first.
The UpdateTask or PreConfigurationTask capabilities are good examples.
We need something like an InstallationTask.

Current WinAppDriver supports only win 10, it would be great if we have support to Win 7 and 8

Please add to Manage users Account-level permission "Show notifications" for disable/enable this option.

Completely separate out UWP from its ties with sandboxing and the windows store.
If we look at .appx/the new installation mechanism as a much saner version of app installation, then the more applications it allows, the better.
Centennial takes big steps towards that, but I'd like to go even further.
My example: An interactive screen sharing app.
It requires uiAccess (if I recall correctly, so that it can intercept alt+tab for sending to the remote host) and elevated privileges (so that it can send input events to elevated processes such as regedit, taskmgr, etc for when the remote user has control.)
As far as I know, this wouldn't be possible with Centennial as it exists today, but these kinds of apps are still valuable.
It would be nice to be able to have the best of both worlds.

The most important file types are being restricted from being opened by any application aka devs can not register to use .mp3, .txt, .etc.
Without this functionality how can we make apps that allow users to do anything useful with their files.
For example: I want to open a .mp3 in an audio remixer or a video in an app to upload videos.
And I want to do this from within another app (skydrive) or from an email attachment or web browser.
Right now it just opens up in xbox music.
i can play the file and then its gone.

I like new Flyout control that has been introduced in Windows 8.1 but I think Placement property should be improved since I cannot show a Flyout at the bottom-left or bottom-right of a button (like logged menu Flyout in Windows).
I think Placement should be splitted in HorizontalPlacement (Left, Center, Right) and VerticalPlacement (Top, Bottom) to have more flexibility.

Give ability to create games that have access for xbox live achievements.
It doesn't have to be full access.
Still only partners can have a "Xbox live" mark on their game icon, but having a one place for achievements, leader boards and friends would be great (WP7 Live?)

Right now you can only get themes from the windows store from Microsoft directly.
You should allow devs to post their own themes on the Microsoft store like they can on the Chrome Web Store.

more and more people telephone over voip but there are many different provider.

APIs do not support the configuration of the window background colour.
This means that if, like Groove (Music), an app uses a non-white background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size.
As someone who cares about attention to detail and delivering the best possible experience this sloppiness in the API is incredibly annoying.

We need a background task system event to update the wide tile (and the lock screen) message when the device wakes up (the lock screen becomes visible) on Windows Phone 8.1 (universal apps).
The message needs to be updated with every date change (once in 24 hours), but as the BG task does not run when the phone is asleep, the messages is not updated when the user wakes up his device, and the lock screen (and the wide tile) displays a previous date's message.
The messages is updated only when the app is activated by the user.
This is not a satisfactory user experience - the user expects the lock screen showing the current date's message.

Allow XAML winRT apps to change the lock screen background.
Currently, this is only supported for silverlight :(

Might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page.

I find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and it's never vey good.
I'd love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a 2D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel.
The control should:
* Allow the placement of rectangular items in 2D
* Allow the user to select items, drag them around and resize them.
(An optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items.)
* Allow panning and zooming.
The look and content of the items should, of course, be customizable.

Some testers do not understand the criteria for certification.
I have a tester who failed my game multiple times, and a supervisor who backed him up, but both are dead wrong as seen from reading their own failure report.
The criteria that the game needs to meet is listed right on the fail report:
1) Play a music file.
2) Launch the application.
3) Verify that while the application loads, it does not pause, resume or stop the actively playing music.
Then here is the reason they list for failing it:
"Select YES when asked to play music, observe that the games music plays simultaneously with the phones music"
By their own reasoning, you can see that my game MET the criteria, by not pausing, resuming, or stopping the music.
This tester changed the criteria.
What's worse is that his boss, Eric Dunaway, agreed with the tester in his misreading of the criteria.

The MapControl is quite limited in operations with custom tiles.
I have need to redraw the tiles periodically, because they become outdated (the closest similar example is traffic layer, which needs to be periodically refreshed).
The (ugly) workaround I use is adding and removing MapTileSource, which forces tiles redraw.
Even more, since this operation results in tiles flickering (because of redraw), I have to use 3 tile sources, switching between them.
That crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map, and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of MapTileSource adding (which would be nice to fix too).
I'd also be happy, if MapTileSource property changes (like Bounds) were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back (this is how it can be done currently).
So we need some method which would force MapTileSource to re-query tile images, which would result in fresh tiles download or custom rendering (depending on concrete MapTileDataSource).

Add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the UWP app.
Really helpful for drawing apps!

I made a UWP app with a ListView (using KeepLastItemInView).
On many systems (probably the slower ones), the scrolling behavior is very odd.
Using the touchpad/mousewheel, the scrollbar starts moving, but not the contents of the ListView.
After a while the contents start moving, but there is no way to move to the very top or very bottom using only the touchpad/mousewheel.
I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom/top of the ListView.
This behavior is not consistent.
On other systems is works as expected.

Currently if an App developer submits an update to an exsiting LOB app , the update bypasses the business store and the app is automaticallyupdated.
There should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the "New LOB apps" section, under manage apps.
this gives enterprises the control of when the updated app is deployed to their users, i.e so that is does not conflict with other updates  etc

IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomInputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomInputNodeAsync(AudioEncodingProperties encodingProperties, IMediaExtension customMediaSurce);
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomInputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomInputNodeAsync(String customMediaSourceActivationId, IPropertySet customMediaSourceSettings)
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomInputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomInputNodeAsync(AudioEncodingProperties encodingProperties, String customMediaSourceActivationId, IPropertySet customMediaSourceSettings);
for output nodes
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomOutputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomOutputNodeAsync(IMediaExtension customSink);
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomOutputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomOutputNodeAsync(AudioEncodingProperties encodingProperties, IMediaExtension customSink);
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomOutputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomOutputNodeAsync(String customSinkActivationId, IPropertySet customSinkSettings)
IAsyncOperation&lt;CreateAudioCustomOutputNodeResult&gt; AudioGraph.CreateCustomOutputNodeAsync(AudioEncodingProperties encodingProperties, String customSinkActivationId, IPropertySet customSinkSettings);

Posted in stackoverflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52947707/performance-issue-in-windows-web-http-httpclient.
I have been using the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient for my API Requests.
My HttpClient is a singleton.
I analyzed the resource timing for my API calls with the Network Profiler in Visual Studio.
In the Timings split-up, I see that the Waiting (TTFB) part takes the most time (about 275ms.
Sometimes it goes as high as 800ms).
As per this https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/understanding-resource-timing, waiting time is the Time spent waiting for the initial response, also known as the Time To First Byte.
This time captures the latency of a round trip to the server in addition to the time spent waiting for the server to deliver the response.
When trying the same API call in different platforms mac(NSUrlSession) or android, the waiting time is significantly lower in same network.
My question is whether this waiting time delay is dependant on the HttpClient implementation?
If not is there anything which needs to be changed in my NetworkAdapter code?

I would propose adding the ability for the SplitView pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen.
This would mimic the Android capability that already exists for its Navigation drawer.
I have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action.
It is in an app called Drudge Live (https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdm04m), and in the app the swipe-open capability is only enabled on phones.
In the app Settings you can disabled the swipe-open or make the swipe-in detection area wider if the user's phone makes getting close to the screen edge difficult.
Based on feedback I have received, the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand.
I was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users, but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone.
On computers the swipe-in interferes with the normal swipe-in to change apps, which is why I disabled the ability except for use on phones.

When an error occurs it happens a lot that exception.StackTrace is null (in the App UnhandledException handler for instance).

The problem is we can't put try/catch everywhere and we would like to understand crashes but without a stacktrace it is difficult.

In the following MSDN Magazine Article it is mentioned that there are some limits for Voice Command Deffiniton files.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj721592.aspx
7.
Keep in mind the limits: 100 Command elements in a command set; 10 ListenFor entries in a command; 50 total PhraseList elements; and 2,000 total PhraseList items across all PhraseLists.
Please increase these limits (Maybe as an opt in).
I use Windows SAPI quite intensively for an application I have built and many Grammars are easily much bigger than the limits imposed by Cortana.
This makes it a bit tricky to port the recognition engine part of the application away from SAPI and towards Cortana since SAPI provides more powerful capabilities for larger sets of commands.


Hello guys,
I experienced problem with UWP ListView, particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.
A few words about problem context:
In our UWP app there is a ListView, and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.
And while next part of data is loading, ListView is disabled.
So, the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down,
when you scroll to the end of the list, ListView will be disabled for some period of time (while data is loading).
And if you release mouse button from ScrollBar
while ListView is blocked, then some strange behavior of ScrollBar appears after ListView became enabled..
You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it, ScrollBar goes upper.
The only way to return its normal behavior is to try to hover it while it isn't in the very top of the ListView.
And after that right click on it helps to return ScrollBar to the normal behavior.
Note 1: I've got success with experiencing this problem in UWP app created from scratch (used ListView and ISupportIncrementalLoading).
I'd like to attach sample app, but I don't understand how (of course if it possible).
Note 2: if discard of using ISupportIncrementalLoading,
the problem exists, but a bit another kind of.
Thanks in advance!

Helps identify battery issues.

Currently it is not possible to change the package identity name of an app once it has been published, which is a bit frustrating.

Currently apps are executed in sandboxes and there's no way to apps can work together.
E.g.
one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes..
The same is true for applications and the OS itself.
Some kind of handlers on context menus of certain objects would be great.
E.g.
the context menu of images could list tasks provided by apps dealing with images.
In more detailed/extremely simplified: What about having an app that rotates an image, an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer.

Allow us to query device information from a 100% native C++ application so we are not forced to use C#.

This was promised years ago, but every release it seems CreateFile2 continues to deny access to file paths stored in FutureAccesList.

I would like to see an improvement on Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.PhoneCallManager when launched the UI for call with ShowPhoneCallUI mehtod.
Something like:
- call completed
- call cancelled
- call failed
and on the arguments some information like call duration
Thank you so much for this chance!

I wish you would make possible the inclusion of a field in the changlog to version next to the information of the changes as well as make available a field to include the last version available at the end of the description of the app for simple update.

Sometimes ListView sends a changing event with InRecycleQueue set to true, but sometimes, even with an item that is being recycled it just goes straight to phase 0.
So what's the point of InRecycleQueue other than to confuse me?
Just go straight to phase 0 and train developers to clear their UI elements on phase 0.

I'd like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file, as well as support for setting log levels.

Much effort was made in WPF Xaml Serialization to decouple it from the presentation assemblies and moved into its own assemblies, System.Xaml, and System.Windows.Markup.
This Xaml System had it's own serialization/deserialization mechanism in XamlServices class.
Furthermore, this Xaml system had a very powerful component/concept that is conspicuously absent in WinRT: Markup Extensions.
Markup Extensions are found in the following Xaml Systems:
- WPF
- Silverlight 5
- Xamarin.Forms (notably NOT a Microsoft technology, but recognizes their power nonetheless)
This feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF/System.Xaml.
That means:
- Custom Markup Extensions
- XamlServices.Load and Save
- All default system markup extensions "{x:Null}, {x:Static}, etc."
found in WPF/Silverlight5.
- IProvideValueTarget interface
- INameScope interface
- ... and more!
YEAH!!!
XAML!!!
WHOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Per https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/15094191-packagelayout-value-is-not-stored-with-vsdproj, we manually inject the PackageLayout msbuild property into the .vsdproj for source control purposes.
The vsdproj extension doesn't immediately load this value into the project property window (PackageLayout text box) until you change your Configuration from its current value, to something else, and back again.
0.
Unload the .vsdproj
1.
Copy property from .vsdproj.user and inject into .vsdproj manually, removing the Configuration condition expression
2.
Delete the .user file
3.
Reload .vsdproj
4.
View project properties, note PackageLayout is blank
5.
Change Configuration from Debug to Release, then back to Debug
6.
Note PackageLayout is now filled in

I have some MapPolygon filling with a semitransparent color, like Color.FromArgb(85, 255, 255, 0);, the color always changes because of zooming in the map.

The VisualStateManager ignores Visual State Setters using custom attached properties.
This works with normal attached properties, so it's confusing that it doesn't work for custom ones.
The hack to get this to work is really ugly and requires custom code for every case using reflection: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/expression/en-US/0f9826e1-48d2-4cd7-8253-a5b9aaf0e03d/uwpadaptative-triggers-with-custom-attached-properties-in-windows-10-uwp

User should be able to style the Carousel items like we do for ListViewItems/ListBoxItems.

There is only one direction for the radial progress bar control (clockwise).
It would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise.

As per https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/events/build/2017/dev-center-analytics-for-win32-developers?playlist=Dev-Center-Store-Services, the Dev center has support to monitor Crash reports for native win32 desktop apps without publishing into the store.
But I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.

Currently it is really painful to add new Controls from newer Windows SDK versions to apps and still support older versions.
There needs to be a way to define new XAML Controls/Properties/Etc., as currently if you want to add these, with a lower Minimum version, it has to be from code-behind.
Ways this could potentially be fixed:
Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions, and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions, therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.
Like how Xamarin.Forms does it, instead of &lt;On Platform="IOS"&gt;&lt;/ On&gt;,
we could have &lt;On MinSDK="10.0.16190.0"&gt;&lt;TreeView/&gt;&lt;/On&gt;, then we could have an else conditional or something to have replacement XAML that would provide a TreeView like experience.
This would be really helpful when it comes to upcoming Fluent Design, supporting new Fluent Design Styles, and Supporting the Design Waves.
Alternatively, it would be nice if the UWP platform was updated separately from Windows, so apps would be able to support all the new Controls/Styles.
I'm pretty sure the new TreeView is not Fall Creators Update dependent.

Selenium can handle web based alert pop ups but unable to handle windows based alert pop ups such as the Windows to download or upload files, or the Print window.
Current solution to handle this scenario is using Autoit but not the most elegant solution.
It would be good see an integrated solution.

Silverlight cached Application.LoadComponent, it was perfect.

Currently any UWP developer is forced to use C++ for accessing DirectX features or rely on third party support like SharpDX or Unity3D for those features.
Please expose the DirectX COM API as UWP one, having the API coming from Microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or in-house wrappers.

This bug is easy to reproduce:
var wbmp = new WriteableBitmap(480,640);
await wbmp.SetSourceAsync(stream); //the stream comes from a picture with larger size, i.e.
960x1280
Now check the properties of wbmp:
PixelWidth: 960
PixelHeight: 1280
PixelBuffer.Length: 1228800
The length of PixelBuffer is totally wrong, the buffer size shoud be 960 x 1280 x 4 = 4915200
The wrong value 1228800 comes from the original size: 480 x 640 x 4.
I think this is a bug, because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property, it should also update the PixelBuffer, or the data is inconsistent.

Add the duration control found in Alarms &amp; Clock app under the countdown timer section to the standard set of control avaialble to the developer through visual studio

Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters, this suggests that a third-party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages.
I am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to Android's startActivityForResult() using the page stacks, but I have no visibility into the management of the page stacks (BackStack and ForwardStack).
This introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations.

The Windows Imaging Component WICBitmapInterpolationMode enumeration has supported the value WICBitmapInterpolationModeHighQualityCubic since Windows 10 was first released.

I need a way to create a mouse cursor (CoreCursor) from my own data, such as:
RGBA8 array of pixel colors
int w, int h - size of the image
int x, int y - hot_spot in the image.
Currently there's no way to dynamically create a mouse cursor.
All Win32, Mac, Linux have API's to do so, but UWP doesn't.
I manage the images, files and resources using my own toolset, so I need to be able to create a cursor from that data.


ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use, for two reasons: locking, and placement.
1.
Locking.
Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time, a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(1,1) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).
In other words, the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code.
Recommendation: ContentDialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to.
This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.
2.
Placement.
If ShowAsync() or ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.Popup) is used, then the location of the dialog is not well controlled.
Depending on circumstances it may be centered, left, top, etc relative to the app window, with no direct control over this by the programmer.
On the other hand, if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used, then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.
For example, an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML.
To have a dialog that can be used at any time and that always shows centered on the main window of the app, you must have two copies of the dialog, one embedded in XAML and shown using InPlace, but only if it is loaded; and the other not embedded in XAML and shown using Popup.
(In addition per (1) above a lock of some kind is needed).
Recommendation: add a parameter to ShowAsync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app (centered, left, right, bottom).

Each JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play() function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows 10 update 10.0.15063.608
You can easily reproduce the behaviour using your own sample code at:
https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/CameraGetPreviewFrame/js
https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/CameraStarterKit/js
This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews.
For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.

The ComboBox now automatically has the infinite scrolling behavior when lots of items are present.

Please add support C++/CX extension and type system for Desktop platform.
It's very important for support legacy projects written on MFC.

It's good if COM/COM+ technology continue with C++/CX and universal type system.
And it's good if it will be work on Windows 7 too.

In WPF you can use textures and patterns for your app background with the TileBrush class.

HTTP.sys serves as the kernel component backing IIS and the .NET HttpListener.
As such, it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming HTTP request, but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics.
There are a number of failure cases, such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue, that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack.
This leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems.
Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and a few Perf counters.
Neither is ideal.
The log file is system-wide, requires admin access, and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with.
Meanwhile, the perf counters are difficult to associate with a specific application, requiring the request queue be named (which HttpListener does not do) and "netsh" called to find URL group IDs to use for correlation.
I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored, both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers.
New HTTP Server and HttpListener APIs  should be added that surface the failures and request queue state.

Getting version and changelog info in Microsoft Store on WIndows 10 is way to hard.

No info regarding last update.
I want to know what date it was updates, what version number it currently has, and weather the developer provided a changelog.

Currently XInput does not support Force Feedback effects such as applying actual forces in Joysticks, Steering Wheels and similar devices.
Developers need to write additional code -using the "deprecated" DirectInput API- to access those devices even though Microsoft states that use of DirectInput should be avoided and XInput used instead for any gamepad functionality.
There should be an update to XInput API that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from DirectInput.

Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code:
&lt;TextBox HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" IsSpellCheckEnabled="False" IsTextPredictionEnabled="False" /&gt;

This works as expected on phones but not on computers/tablets.

It is possible to disable suggestions in the settings, but I guess apps should be able to disable this themselves.

In the Windows.Data.PDF API, on implementing PdfDocument.LoadFromFileAsync I receive an unspecified error.

Right now, if an app has (in the appx manifest) "en" language (no region specified), users in the US won't see the app in the store if they have the preference "make it easier to find apps in my language" to "yes".
So the developer has to specify "en", "en-us" and probably several other languages + describe the store page accordingly, all with identical data.
It would make sense, i think, that "en" (no region) language will be used as a fallback for all "en" countries if there is no "en-region" specified.

The SD Card support in WP8 is practically useless because built-in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as 'reserved file and URI associations'.
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj207065(v=vs.105).aspx)
This means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the SD card.
Many WP8 devices ship with only 8GB, which makes the use of the SD card essential, especially to store large files, such as video.
We are presently working on a WP8 version of an app to play sign language videos, but are stymied by this restriction.
We cannot read (or even see) any .mp4 files on the SD card.
This limitation basically stops our project for WP8.
Of course, we have iOS and Android versions that work on phones.
Our own project aside, it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any third-party apps from competing with the built-in apps.
Just looking at the list of reserved file types - seems like all file types known to man are reserved.
And then I remind myself that this is just on the SD card.
But then what is the point of the SD card, if the developer is restricted to the phone's internal memory...

Make debugging for winrt user friendly.
In 99 percent of cases I receive MeasureOverride exception or "Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component.".
No matter what the problem is you'll get that kind of useless information.
Which means that something went wrong.
No stacktrace and guess yourself is what WinRT development looks like.

When you are developing an app, the generic policies will make sense.
But when a developer submitted an app and it's failing for a reason/policies, it's worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his/her app.
What are the things went wrong, rather than saying your app failing on 2.11 (it's generic message) will be no use, as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies.
If you simply say an app failed with the policy number 2.11 or so, what can a developer benefit out of it, rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times, it will be frustrating.
After a little while, developer may think that, anyway they are not going thru, what's the point in spending time here.
Be responsible and give more &amp; specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.
May be this works with a firm/company, but for independent developers you are the source &amp; you are the helper.

WinDbg is a fundamental and very important tool in developing for Windows.
Unfortunately, it is also bug-infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in 2015.
Examples include:
- a (assemble) doesn't supporting 64-bit!
- .call messes up the stack on x64 with more than 4 parameters
- GUI still looks horrible
- GUI is single-threaded and blocking on every step.
When it's stuck (*BUSY*) you sometimes can't stop it for several minutes.
- PDB loading and parsing is still slow, and that's after the fix that took you many months to solve (https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1017787/msdia120-dll-handles-zo-pdb-files-extremely-slowly).
- Extensions don't work consistently on various versions/builds of Windows.
The solution is open-sourcing WinDbg and related tools (dbghlp, WinDbg extensions, etc.
), which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at Microsoft doesn't manage to.
Obviously Microsoft will be the lead, and changes such as extensions supporting parsing of new versions of internal OS structures will come from Microsoft, but open-sourcing WinDbg will allow the community fix bugs like the one in .call without having to wait on Microsoft to do that.

Currently when the last element(s) of the tile doesn't fit (because of users with unusual scaling settings for example) it get's "discarded" out of view which is understandable.
But it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case there's isn't enough space on the tile.
It also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info.

It should be possible to enumerate all available app extensions from the Store, particularly those which are not installed.
This will allow to implement in-app extension catalog, which is a common scenario.
I haven't found any possible way to do that, so I assume it doesn't exist currently.


As a developer, I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
When I click a customer group to manage, it opens in a new window, unlike most of the other links in the dashboard.
This may seem minor but it's a huge irritant.

Add ADO.NET to the Silverlight .Net framework so you can use DataSets when working with XML and Relational Data via C# in Windows Phone 7.

Having to RE enter things like version number, application name, etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes.
In the App manifest I've already put the version number, and I've already put the application name.
When I upload this XAP to the store, look at the manifest and pre-populate the corresponding fields in my submission instead of giving me a chance to mismatch them.

Could someone answer my question, please?
The Windows Bridge does not create a correct output files.

Currently IncrementalLoading doesn't work when setting ListView/GridView's ItemsPanel to StaggeredPanel (or other custom panel)

Would e nice to make split view behave the way Surface home screen behaves OOB.
We end up writing lot of custom Styles in XAML for Split view.
Further, SPlitview should have option to display only the button in compact mode.Right now in compact mode the pane is always visible.
There are few standard patterns for navigation and if Split view has those OOB then developing apps because a breeze.
Developers should be focusing more on App as opposed to implement the standard navigation pattern and spend effort on styling.

Live tiles are great.
Would prefer some way to great animated live tiles like the Xbox games or music apps.
Also good if we have a convenient way to create live tiles from xaml.
Currently need to generate a bitmap image which not works well for list, etcxe2x80xa6

Allow a frame by frame capture from MediaCapture, so that developers can more easily create streaming protocols, without having to relay on the ugly and poorly documented Media Foundation API for trivial tasks.

x:Bind is great and I love it.
But it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file.
In such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties, like for example TwoWay for TextBox.TextProperty.

It would be nice to be able to assign a (compiled) binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors.
Because if you currently assign a Binding a VisualState setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself.
This will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to x:Null for performance (handy in complex screens).
Sample:
&lt;VisualState.Setters&gt;
  &lt;!-- This will assign the value of ViewModel.Sample and not the binding itself --&gt;
  &lt;Setter Target="Label.Text" Value="{Binding ViewModel.Sample, ElementName=Page, Mode=OneWay" /&gt;
&lt;/VisualState.Setters&gt;

We have implemented a FastObservableCollection (see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/blob/8e11fda46dccb487787dc955a79b194c26ac15e0/src/Catel.MVVM/Catel.MVVM.Shared/Collections/FastObservableCollection.cs#L438)
When adding (or removing) a lot of items, we suspend the events and will raise a *single* event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period.
This makes the collection much faster to work with when making large changes.
Before recent changes, we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.
In the current version, we have optimized the collection so it knows *exactly* what has changed in the suspension state.
We will only invoke the correct Add / Remove actions for all the items.
Unfortunately it looks like the UI components (in this case a ListBox) cannot deal with the .Add and *multiple items*.
This does not work:
eventArgsList.Add(CreateEventArgs(NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, suspensionContext.NewItems, suspensionContext.NewItemIndices));
The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes (all covered by unit tests).
This does work:
1.
Raise single events (but it's bad for performance)
for (int i = 0; i &lt; suspensionContext.NewItems.Count; i++)
  eventArgsList.Add(CreateEventArgs(NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, suspensionContext.NewItems[i], suspensionContext.NewItemIndices[i]));
2.
Raise reset event
eventArgsList.Add(CreateEventArgs(NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset, suspensionContext.NewItems, suspensionContext.NewItemIndices));
For some notes on the investigation, see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/issues/1066
I *think* this is a bug in the way the UI components deal with the NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs instance.
If it's add, the components don't loop all the
e.NewItems but simple pick the first one.
I don't see this limitation documentated anywhere (but I might have missed it).
I checked these docs:
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.specialized.notifycollectionchangedeventargs(v=vs.110).aspx
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Interop.NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs


We note that microsoft bought Skype, so we need an app that includes Facebook chat, Skype chat, video call and normal calling.

Have an API for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background.
One possible use case:
A smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet.
For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone, but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone (maybe timed, maybe because user presses a button on the phone) to send a request, which the service on the phone then handles (some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved)
The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories.

Now we can just use pivot and panorama,but we can not handle their sensitive degree,sometimes I feel it's so high,and I want to edit it but no way to do this.

I reported that since studio 15.4.3 the designer crash due to attached properties

I would like to read currently played song or content in Windows 10.
Use case: As neither Groove nor Spotify have a lyrics functionality (anymore) I created a simple UWP app to manage lyrics for songs.
I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now.
To solve that, it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps.
Following data would be great:
- Title
- Artist
- Album cover (optional)
- App name
- Is playing or not
- Is audio (optional)
- Content changed handler to update the UI without checking every x secs
Then in the app the user could select which app should be "listened" to and whenever a song changes it will look up in its database and load and show the lyrics.

In UWP, there are a variety of pickers to pick single or multiple files async, there is a picker for picking folders, but no picker to pick multiple folders.
When you need to copy only certain folders, or scan for files on multiple folders but not all, this would be very useful.

Something that would really give the MapControl a leg up over ESRI would be the ability to create a ShapeFile object and pass it as a parameter to something like: MapElement.CreateElementsFromShapefile(shapefile) and get a list of MapElements that could be added to the map.

Need timeout on read from StreamSocket just like with old .net sockets and serialport.
Now you have destroy the complete connection if a device on a Bluetooth serial connection does not respond.
While this makes no sense at all.
there nothing wrong with the connection, it is just a serial device not responding.

An API so the Facebook integration features can be expanded upon as well as other social networks added

The FileOpenPicker has the SuggestedStartLocation and the official description of how it works is:
"The SuggestedStartLocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker.
To give the user a sense of consistency, the file picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location."
So SuggestedStartLocation remembers where you were, and continues to open that same folder every time.
This is not always the best solution, for example, pretend you had a UWP app that asked the user to select a picture and a music file.
In this situation, SuggestedStartLocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file, the FileOpenPicker is opening in the PicturesLibrary.
Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want.

In UWP we have a CommandBar, but it seems it's not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application.
A toolbar stacks items from left-to-right, and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models

Our primary UWP app is currently compiled as x86 only because there are some limitations of C++ libs we use.
We've discovered just today, that WebGL does not work in WebView in UWP apps compiled as x86 on Windows 10 1803.
Any idea, if this will be fixed in a cummulative update?

At the moment there are only APIs for reading and writing NFC Tags.
Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities.
With an ISO14443 Smartcard support, you would be able to communicate with Smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via NFC Credit Cards.
These capabilities are well supported by other platforms and I would like to see this support on WP8 too.

Implement native APIs for communicating with BLE devices / 'ibeacons.'

Being unable to set up our own set of contacts to test with is incredibly frustrating, especially as the test set doesn't even cover all scenarios (none have photos, for example).

S/MIME email is a mandatory requirement at my company and support for that on the Windows Phone platform is needed before we can consider it.

Get back the Offiline Symbols download,

The SwipeControl control should support mouse input as well as touch input.
Currently it only supports touch input.
I appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces.
However on a platform that allows for a single app to run on both desktop and touch devices I think that users will be expecting to be able to interact with the app in similar ways across devices.
Microsoft have set precedent for this in their own apps.
Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement (that can be interacted with using a mouse) for marking emails as read or unread (among other things).
I personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps, but currently am unable to do so.

Add movies and books would be an excellent addition for the system !

After registering a company account I kept getting the message 'The VAT ID we have doesnxe2x80x99t appear to work.
', although the input was accepted by the form.
After contacting a Microsoft employee it became clear that this message is the result of the vetting/validation process of my account.
Maybe this could be more clarified so users won't be confused.

I'm trying to use the API for Contacts in the namespace Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts, but it doesn't work as expected.
First of all, on Windows Phone 8.1 I always get an IOException when trying to call PickContactAsync().
This is very strange, since I was expecting to see at least Contacts app to be launched, seems there's some problem establishing the contract.
I also checked the Contacts permission was enabled on the Package.appxmanifest.
On Windows 8.1 / RT 8.1 che call to the PickContactAsync() works but I receive wrong data instaed, for example:
FirstName and LastName are both in FirstName (and LastName is empty), the ImportantDates (e.g.
Birthday) are always set to low values (like 05/05/0004), but if I try to navigate the contacts through Outlook.com or Contacts/People app I can see the right values.
Maybe I'm missing something, but this API seems to be broken.

(Administrator: I am listing this one as a bug, because I consider it a existing security issue that can be exploited at present, but please feel free to categorize it however you see fit, as always!)
There is what I consider a security issue in UWP applications, that I feel should be addressed.
Namely, when the user goes to authenticate their application with a 3rd party authentication provider (e.g.
Facebook, Google), the control that is used to handle the process does not display the URL to the user, so they do not know where the content is being loaded from and if it is trusted/authentic.
Therefore, malicious parties could use any URL/location they would like under their control for the WebAuthenticationBroker.Authenticate* calls to phish the credentials of users of this process, as users do not see/understand the URL in which the process is loading the content for the authentication workflow and therefore cannot validate its authenticity.
It would be great to see some improvements in this area to show the user exactly where the content is being loaded from, as well as any certificates (green/red/warnings -- the same you see in browsers) so that they get the "warm n' fuzzies" during the sign in process and know that they can provide their credentials in confidence to the application.
For context, here are the steps (as I understand them) that can be used to exploit this process:
1) Create a sign-in page that looks exactly like the signin page from Google or Facebook (or your authentication service provider of choice).
For starters, you would create this by going to target provider's login page and saving the source of the file and use that as the starting point.
2) Modify the file made in the previous step so that it takes user input and passes it to the real authentication service provider.
Account for when the credentials pass and for when they fail.
3) Find a server to host the above file, deploy the file(s) (perhaps multiple files, as it could involve server-side magic) to this host and get the URL to the deployed location that loads this file.
4) Create a UWP application that gets the user to login to a supported credential provider via the WebAuthenticationBroker.
In the WebAuthenticationBroker.AuthenticateAsync call, provide the URL to the deployed location in the previous step.
5) Deploy the application to the Windows Store.
Get users to download it and use it (How exactly?
That is where your creativity comes in!
;) ).
6) Have the user sign into your page (thinking it is a legitimate credential location -- the one you are impersonating).
Since it has been confirmed that UWP and WebAuthenticationBroker does not display the URL/domain the user is signing into, it can be anywhere that is under your control and the user will not know.
7) Validate credentials using the real authentication provider.
If it works, pass the user on to the real sign in page (or better yet, simply set cookies on the user's session that makes it seem all is OK).
8) Once you have obtained validated credentials, store the credentials for a later time, or use them for nefarious purposes immediately.
9) Rule planet Earth with your new-found powers (OK I made this one up :) )
For reference, this is based on a thread started in the MSDN forums, which you can see here for additional information:

Thank you for any consideration!

Continuing my prior post about allowing us to explicitly flip secondary live tiles with a tap instead of launching the app, this request would allow such an action to explicitly update the tile by triggering a function call in a background task.
For instance, normally a stock price tile updates every 30 minutes via a background task, but if you tap it, the quote updates instantly.
Or perhaps you have a tile that shows you where you are--restarurant or wherever--and you simply tap it to check in there.
No need to open the app.
Since it's user-initiated, it wouldn't drain the battery.
Perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating/updating the tile... Flip the tile, execute a background task (or both), or simply launch the app like normal (possibly with deep toast.)
That would really make LiveTiles 'Live' which now, they kind of aren't and were by *far* the biggest disappointment when we saw the actual SDK.
Coming from iOS, when we did see that, we scrapped two apps we were going to release on WP7.
(A third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every 30 minutes, which is sort of the same 'stale data' issue as here.)

Currently, In MasterView, we can only use ListView.
It limits the use case of MasterView.
We can't use Pivot, Semantic Zoom, GridView, PullToRefresh, SlidableListItem and more.
But if it accepts ContentPresenter then the limit would be endless.
Don't fake the page navigation using Storyboard.
Then devs can use Connected Animations.

A lot of different apps are needed to wake up in exact time and do something.
For example, timer and alarm apps.
So we need improvement TimeTrigger class with AlarmApplicationManager accuracy.
And it should be possible to wait these triggers for many apps in the same time.

When testing applications in Hyper-V guests the automatic checkpoint feature makes it easy to remove all the changes that the application makes, but you need to tell it to remove the changes each time.
How about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts?

The ability to have video on Live Tiles.
For instance instagram, vimeo videos.
Goals of the week, of the favourites teams.
Best plays.
That would rock live tiles capabilities to extreme...

I noticed some programs are using the hardware device id for giving comfort to the user - even after reset.
This is a privacy fault since I cannot delete all internet stored data connected to this id.
So I won't sell my phone.
For this I would like an user id (anonymous) so my data "move" to my other phones and delete from phones without logged in live account.
There should be a random id instead after every reset.

Please, to have competitive advantage, i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast.
thank you.

isn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?
currently it supposes to be reading all names from some dll files in the xap bundle,(if you have support for different languages) but it failed, and the name displayed in app store can actually harm the ranking of the app.
creating those dlls is a pain in the xxx .

Please,  add to next update normal content (picture, sound, video etc.
from sandbox) share as Android.
If it impossible becouse we don't have a right then do it  how MemoryStream or SharedMemoryStream.

When testing the discoverability of our desktop app listing on the Microsoft store, we have noticed that when searching for it by name from the US version of the Microsoft web site (not the UK one), that it appears in this listing:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/result.aspx?q=fieldmove
However, clicking on the result link
http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/4b15cd35-cbdf-4798-955b-6224e66a604a
results in a page not found error.
We would prefer it either to show the app's page in the store, or to not be included in the results at all if it appears to create an error.
We have noticed that this is the case for other desktop apps that have store listings, too.

Make it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles, such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen.

Since 2009, the advent of Silverlight PivotViewer Control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data.

It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input.
It should work like a horizontal ListView or GridView...so you can normally scroll through the listed items, but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge-like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old View/Page/List.

Currently it's a mixture of some taxes are collected by MS, some have to get paid by the developer.
As a smaller business, this is a huge effort and only theoretically possible.
It would be great, if MS would collect all the required taxes.
As far as I am informed, the competition (Apple App Store, Google Play) does this aswell.
Also, MS used to collect more taxes than nowadays.
Look at this old feature request quoting an older Developer Agreement:

h. Taxes on App Transactions.
If you choose to have Microsoft make your app available for customers in the United States, any current member country of the European Union, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan or Liechtenstein (Remittance Countries), Microsoft (or its billing service provider) will collect and remit sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any, applicable to your app as made available in such country(s) through the Windows Store.
It states "any current member country of the European Union", which includes e.g.
Austria (also at the time of the post).
Nowadays (Jan 13th, 2016), the Dev Agreements lists Austria as a country, which the developer has to collect the taxes:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt148553.aspx
Austriat| Price being selected is the final sale price and includes any applicable taxes.
| 70% of selected price | Developer
I cannot express what great improvement it would be, if Microsoft takes care of this and the developer is sure, that what he gets paid is "net".
Thank you for your time!

Currently it is possible to specify multiple groups/subgroups within the various tile sizes for adaptive tiles, but if the content doesn't fit then some groups won't necessarily ever be shown (they are dropped since the tile can't fit the groups).
It would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups, where the current size can't fit all the groups, those groups would automatically cycle around (similar to MSN news live tile or calendar app, but in this case an individual notification would be cycling, rather than a queue of separate notifications)

Fix Altitude Bug in GeoCoordinateWatcher and Geolocator when using in WP8.
On my lumia 520 (WP8) i get jumping values of altitude, even outdor with a strong and good GPS-signal.
The altitude jumps from 27m to 200m up and down, 200m is the right value.
The values from GPS-accuracy are top.
This occurs In both classes on WP8.
I always use the DisiredAccuray = high!
I have read, that another user have the same problem with WP8-Phone, like HTC.
All GPS-App in the store have the same problem with the jumping altitude.
But i found a solution.
If you take the  Geolocator class an set the DesiredAccuracyInMeters = 1; (Yes  set to 1), then the altitude never jumps anymore!!!
Please fix the Problem in the WP8-SDK

System.Exception: 'Catastrophic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8000FFFF (E_UNEXPECTED))'
Minimal repro:
                var mediaSource = MediaSource.CreateFromUri(new Uri("https://mediaplatstorage1.blob.core.windows.net/windows-universal-samples-media/sintel_trailer-480p.mp4"));
                var ChatTrack = new TimedMetadataTrack("test", "English", TimedMetadataKind.Custom);
                mediaSource.ExternalTimedMetadataTracks.Add(ChatTrack);
                var cue2 = new TimedTextCue
                {
                    StartTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(120),
                    Id = "TEST",
                };
                ChatTrack.AddCue(cue2);
                var cue3 = new TimedTextCue

                ChatTrack.AddCue(cue3);

It looks like instances of AudioVideoCaptureDevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated.
The disposal appears to be done in the runtime code, as none of my disposal code runs in these situations.
This is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and ActivatedEventArgsIsApplicationInstancePreserved == true, because all application memory should be intact.
But it isn't, because the AudioVideoCaptureDevice instance has been auto-magically disposed.
This can be difficult to detect if the device is used in a deeply embedded object.

Opening a XAML file in Visual Studio is very slow.
Compared to that, a full website (with a lot more mark-up) loads very fast.
I typically edit many different XAML files and always having to wait is very time consuming and frustrating.

When you create a tile dynamically, it is common to want to save it as a Png file so that it uses transparency (so that it respects the theme accent color).
However, there is no built in method to save a WriteableBitmap as a png.
There is however a nice extension to save it to jpg, but that doesn't help if you want to use transparency to leverage the theme accent color in your tile.
I think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue.

When displaying text, I sometimes want all lines to extend the full width of the line, even if that means breaking in the middle of words (I most often want this feature when displaying things such as URLs).
I think this feature should be added by adding an option to the TextWrapping enumeration (maybe TextWrapping.FullLine or TextWrapping.NoWhitespace or TextWrapping.BreakAnywhere).
I feel this is a very basic design style and is used often enough that it should be built into .NET &amp; XAML.

When utilizing the File Picker and specifying one or more extensions, the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions, not show everything but only have those items selectable.
Example:
                            FileOpenPicker picker = new FileOpenPicker
                            {
                                SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.VideosLibrary,
                                ViewMode = PickerViewMode.Thumbnail,
                            };
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".mp4");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".mpg");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".mov");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".mpeg");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".avi");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".wmv");
                            picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".mp2");
                                picker.PickSingleFileAndContinue();
This code will show you EVERY FILE in your pictures library, though clearly I only want videos.
Very frustrating to end users.

I'm looking for something simliar to the include method available for Entity Framework but within Data.Linq namespace of WP7 Mango release.
The objective is to perform something like this.
((ObjectQuery&lt;TEntity&gt;)queryable).Include(path);
The most near thing I've found is the method LoadWith within DataLoadOption class.
Nevertheless, by far it is not enough, because it forces me to load always a navigation property of an entity wherever I load the entity.
If I want to change a DataLoadOption, I have to close the connection, define a new DataLoadOptionObject and open the connection.
Different scenarios require different data, so it is not enough.
The obvious workaround should be to have different entities mapped with the same table of the db each one showing the data needed for a scenario.
However the point is Linq for WP7 doesn't alllow map two entities to the same table ....

Allow WinAppDriver to switch context from native to webview.
This will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary.

The general concept of a ResourceIntensiveTask being launched when constraints are met is strong but the implementation could be greatly improved.
Some RITs (resource intensive tasks) do not require comms and it is absurd to wait for connection to WiFi prior to running them.
Some RITs that ARE comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion.
Some power hungry tasks are high priority and should run as soon as external power is available, not wait an hour while the battery charges to 90%.
Some tasks need to run frequently for very short periods.
For example, logging GPS position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for 2sec every 30sec with another background task running every 30min for perhaps 30sec to send the batched data to a webservice.

scenario: user save a file, app is closed, directory is deleted/renamed, next time: Dlg Save file:
error shown (folder not exist) and shown dir is: windows/system32
expected result should be:
-&gt; act directory is defined by SuggestedStartLocation
-&gt; or 'old' path but one/some directories up
-&gt; the errormessage is not nessesary

We have discovered a major breaking change in Windows SDK Build 17763 for UWP apps upgrading from a previous version.
We have many existing apps (and a minimal repro) which achieves page transitions by setting the Frame.ContentTransitions property.
I get the same result if I set this property in code and/or in XAML.
For example:
rootFrame.ContentTransitions = new TransitionCollection
    new NavigationThemeTransition
    {
        DefaultNavigationTransitionInfo = new DrillInNavigationTransitionInfo()
    }
This is following the recommended guidance here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.navigationthemetransition#remarks
Expected Result:
When calling Frame.Navigate(typeof(AnyPage)), I should see a "drill in" transition to the new page.This is exactly what I get using previous builds (e.g.
17134).
Actual Result:
The new page slides up from the bottom.
Workaround:
It works if I explicitly call Frame.Navigate with the desired transition.
For example:
Frame.Navigate(typeof(AnyPage), parameter, new DrillInNavigationTransitionInfo())
Setting the SDK version specified in project properties back to 17134, and the problem goes away.

In [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&amp;prof=required)  following forum post, the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted.
1) This limit is not in the [EmailMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.email.emailmessage) documentation.
Not helpful.
2) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).
This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.
3) The aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote API as a work around.
This idea is so bad on so many levels.
So, what is the suggestion:
1) Get rid of the [EmailMessage.Body] character limit.
2) If you have such limits, publish them in the API docs.
As a Xamarin.Forms developer, I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation.
As bad as the Android docs are, they at least make an effort to publish limits.
3) DO NOT SUGGEST a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter.
Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users.

there is a bug in UWP where special characters are interpreted as letters when using multi layered keyboard layout like the german Neo2 layout.
Apparently the UIElement.KeyUp and UIElement.KeyDown events provide the wrong VirtualKey information in the KeyRoutedEventArgs.
The problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the On-Screen-Keyboard.
The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win32/WPF application and then Copy&amp;Paste the text into the appropriate fields, which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords.
It's also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots of special charecters like JSON and XML data.
When using a non-multi layered layout (ie.
IBM layout) the VirtualKey information is correct.

As the pervious post has been marked as completed: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/13364760-futureaccesslist-token I'm rising the problem again.
This is still happening - I've tested it myself now after the update to 10.0.14393.953.
My users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app/platform (!)
and I must say that I completely understand them.
How we, the developers, are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update.
This affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform.
The FutureAccessList has an issue.
After a firmware update for my phone I was unable to retrieve folders/files from a token.
The token I was asking for was present in the FutureAccessList but it gave me a FileNotFoundException.

In UWP it's impossible to individually specify Left, Right, Top and Bottom values in XAML for the Thickness struct.
For example, the following is possible in WPF but impossible in UWP:
&lt;Thickness x:Key="MyThickness"
                   Left="{StaticResource LeftOffset}"
                   Top="0"
                   Right="0"
                   Bottom="0"/&gt;
UWP only allows...
     &lt;Thickness x:Key="MyThickness"&gt;5,0,0,0&lt;/Thickness&gt;
Individual values cannot be set in XAML.
This can limit common resources and re-usability and require unnecessary hard-coding of Thickness values.
Please add this capability to UWP Thickness.

Currently there is no way to attach debugger to already running process via 'Attach to process' on mobile.
And sometimes bad bugs, like deadlocks, happens.
And its real pain to investigate them, since usually they happen without debugger and on release builds.
Windows 10 Mobile is like back box you can't get full access to.
In addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes, it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on Windows 10 Mobile any time you want via device portal.
Thanks.

When I set the width of a Grid inside a ListView.ItemTemplate to the ActualWidth of the Parent ListView, the first element won't render content.
If I remove it, the first line renders correctly.
If I remove/re-add that line or add a name/remove a name property, some redraw happens and the first line becomes visible.
I tried to work around it to force an UpdateLayout on the elements, but to no avail.
I packaged the app, tested it on a clean laptop in dev modus and it occurs there as well.
I can provide the sample app that i created in the last 2 days to repro.

 It displays the certificate signer information, but you could easily upload two certificates with different CNs (service names) issued by a single CA and you would have no way of telling them apart.
Minimally it should show the CN from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code, along with the CN of the signer.
Ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md5 hash of the uploaded certificate.

I'd like a way to access the deviceExtendedProperties, specifically the ANID2, in a Windows Store App.
While I realize that WinRT has its own (different) mechanisms for getting a unique hash, the ANID2 allows for seamless compatibility between a Windows Phone app and a Windows RT app, or even a Windows Phone (Silverlight) app and an updated Windows Phone (WinRT) app.
Thank you

Currently it detects whether editable itself.
This should be configurable by the developer.

When creating an app that uses MediaStreamSource to stream audio in Windows Phone 8.0, everything works just great.
When porting this app to Windows Phone 8.1, the sound is flickering and its components are "stack overflow"-ing.
Here is a discussion on MSDN forums:

My problem related with Windows Phone Developer Account only.
Nobody hepls me about this topic in Turkey :( I think it's Microsoft USA's problem :)
When Windows Phone Developer Account started, Turkey is not in the list, so I Choose a country for continue.
Now, Dev account available in Turkey, but I cant change my Country.
Also, when i want open a Windows Store Developer Account , this informations comes with me.
I dont want lose my account, my account will expires at 07.2014, because i open this account with student verification.
"Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Support.
I see that you are currently developing within one region and now want to develop within Turkey.
Turkey being one of the newest opened locations.
While we understand your current situation, we cannot change your region once selected.
Since changing is not an option, you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region.
What we can offer you is the attempt to transfer your apps to the new account.
Please note not all requests can be completed.
But we can certainly attempt this for you.
Since you have mentioned that you are a student account, this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts.
Each account must be active.
If this is something that you would like to look into, please contact DreamSpark as well.
Note, that if you have a Store account, the apps from that side will not transfer.
Currently the option to do so is not present."
Please allow to change country !

Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window's startup position (left, top, width/right, height/bottom), beyond full-screen and/or maximized.
Also, the last used position for a given window isn't saved intrinsically.
Windows launch at random places on the desktop.
I understand this need does not really exist for mobile.
But for many desktop applications, specifically container applications, managing windows is a core feature objective.

Doing something like the actual WebBrowserTask, but with Uri pointing to file in IsolatedStorage

The CLR needs some major performance improvements.
Add SIMD instructions for better use of ARM NEON instructions for math and games.
Also, using a hot swapping code generator (optimized machine code like HotSpot in Java does) would also be very helpful to mitigate slow C# code.

Web View is not supporting ms-appdata:///local URI for rendring images into web pages that are hosted in installed location.

Currently, Microsoft.Phone.Info.DeviceStatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from C# project making it a round way about to include this project in C++ ( managed code).
It would be helpful if we have an equivalent API available in C++.

It would be good to see support for setting a GridView inside a ListView which has the ability to add columns.
This of course can already be found in WPF any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to UWP, this would be a big boost.
An given example of the API can be seen below:
&lt;ListView Margin="10" Name="lvUsers"&gt;
                        &lt;ListView.View&gt;
                                &lt;GridView&gt;
                                        &lt;GridViewColumn Header="Name" Width="120" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Name}" /&gt;
                                        &lt;GridViewColumn Header="Age" Width="50" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Age}" /&gt;
                                        &lt;GridViewColumn Header="Mail" Width="150" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Mail}" /&gt;
                                &lt;/GridView&gt;
                        &lt;/ListView.View&gt;
                &lt;/ListView&gt;

I find the static initializer a bit cumbersome to use, ie:
            MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.Initialize("&lt;ClientId&gt;");
            if (!await MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.LoginAsync())
            {
                var graphClient = MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.GraphProvider;
                var user = await graphClient.Me.Request().GetAsync();
                textBox1.Text = user.DisplayName;
                textBox2.Text = user.Mail;
            }
I'd rather have an instance model:
            var mgs = new MicrosoftGraphService("&lt;ClientId&gt;");
            if (!await mgs.LoginAsync())
            {
                var graphClient = mgs.GraphProvider;
                var user = await graphClient.Me.Request().GetAsync();
                textBox1.Text = user.DisplayName;
                textBox2.Text = user.Mail;
            }
I think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as Initialize.
Would still keep the Instance property to prevent breaking changes

This is not really completely UWP related, but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows 10 versions for testing purposes, as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version.
I'm talking about this website:
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines
The problem is it always provides the latest version only.
All I'm asking is, when a new version of Windows 10 is released, please keep the old VMs still in there.

with this mod we can enjoy the platform more the than ever before is to make in the landscape like the upcoming windows 8 or like the original tile home screen from up to down or down to up

It would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.1

Just like the picture extras ... it'd be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can "share" a piece of text with in addition to email and sms.
This enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info

It would be nice if a choice between vibration and the sound is given for typing

I have more than 20 apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these 20 apps as a number.

Microphone.IsHeadset property now always return true even without headset connected.
It seems like not a good behaviour.
This property should return correct information about connected headset.


At the moment, there is no easy way to prevent a one-way binding from clearing when a DependencyProperty is set to a new value.
It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future, so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one-way binding.

The combination of toasts and Action Center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users, but after notifications are read they disappear.
Some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards.

'm writing this feedback in Desktop Bridge because I think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to Windows Store team.
Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.
I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found.
Currently, the only way to find programs are if you type their names.
There are no keyword searches.
For example, type "notes" or "note taking software" and there are no paid programs displayed.
This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it.
If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge, this is the reason.
Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store.
Apps must be found by keywords.
There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen.
Why not have a closer connection between that team and your team in solving such issues?

The infinite canvas control doesn't have (that I could find) a way to export the ink as an image (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc).
The raw InkCanvas control underneath has ways using the StrokeContainer, but those are both private and unaccessable.
So can we have either a way to export, or can the underlying (my preference) InkCanvas be exposed as public?
Thanks!

Extend the MediaElement to support YouTube videos, so simple.
Most probably you will have to collaborate with Google but this is the challenge!
Unleash the developers power, the Store is going to win!

With UWP, an AppointmentStore retrieved via RequestStoreAsync(AppointmentStoreAccessType.AppCalendarsReadWrite) will still return non-app calendars from GetAppointmentCalendarAsync.
This is different from the Windows Phone 8.1 behavior and inconsistent with FindAppointmentCalendarsAsync (which will not return those calendars).
This can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non-app calendar (until a Save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception).

I have bound the IsPaneOpen of my SplitView to a property in my ViewModel.
This works nicely, except when the SplitView is in Overlay mode and the user presses a hardware back button on the phone.
In this case, the SplitViewPane gets closed, as expected, but it does that by seemingly overwriting the Binding on IsPaneOpen and instead setting it directly to the value "false".
The effect is that the panel can never be opened again, as my code will do this by setting the VM property to "true", but the binding was already lost.
Please fix this.

Include an API to add, remove, deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL), to further drive down data usage, enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking, and just having a sense of control.
Just like on desktop IE.

Seems like there is a problem with a popup, which seems to overlap the application bar.
The strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered.
I've observed it on bot - desktop and mobile UWP app.

As a developer, the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user.
At present there are no APIs to detect whether a user has rated the app or not.
Some users get annoyed and down rate the app due to this very reason.
This is a very basic piece of functionality that has been missing for long.
Please provide us a simple API that gives us this information.
Alternative for us to continue work towards this http://invokeit.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/detect-whether-user-has-reviewed-your-app-or-not-wpdev/ however I am not keen on this purely because I can see this being abused very easily.

Currently when the dialogue with first level of Windows Phone Store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding.
Windows Phone Support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there.
And unbelievably they are doing exactly that.
Azure support system is a very good example how this should work.
In every communication emails the support officer's manager and generic escalation emails are included.
Please do the same for Windows Phone Store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users let down because of sub-pair support quality.
Microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers, who are using that same publisher's applications will be left without further updates and improvements.


WinRT seems to be lacking WPF's DrawBrush or equivalent that would allow us to define icons &amp; imagery in a resource dictionary as xaml artwork and then reuse it throughout the application.
The current workaround of duplicating path data is messy and less flexible as, for example, everything in the artwork must have the same opacity.


New control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality.
eg.
In stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question.

MapControl has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if you're using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer.

There is no way to check if user selected "Show accent color on application title bar" (something like that, I use different language version) in Settings app &gt; Personalization.
I want to know it to make custom title bar that looks exactly as defult one, except with my controls.
I'm able to get SystemAccentBrush, but I can't get actual window title bar's color, becouse it depends on this "Show accent color" setting.

The API is fine, but where I'm running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event.
(Event registration order doesn't seem to make a difference)
This makes for problems with things like:
  1.
Cached SplitView with IsPaneOpen=True inside a Frame that is navigated forward.
(The SplitView captures the first BackRequested rather than the page navigation)
  2.
A Flyout with custom picker UI that uses BackRequested to navigate internally.
To an extent this may be the same as https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/17263004-notify-subscribers-of-systemnavigationmanager-back but it's not quite the same problem.

The pricing model for my app is
- single-time purchase for consumers
- subscription model for enterprise customers
It is nice, that companies can buy my app in bulk, but I'd like them to be able to also buy subscriptions in bulk.

Windows XAML needs a version of DockPanel from WPF.
There are lots of simple scenarios that Grid and RelativePanel just can't handle that require a custom layout today, but could be done in WPF using a simple DockPanel.
DockPanel should be ported to Windows XAML.

Please allow us to maintain all app packages, store assets, descriptions, screenshots, and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload.
Currently it is VERY TEDIOUS and takes HOURS to submit an app update, especially when you have multiple app packages, and lots of languages.
You have to manually use the website to change descriptions, switch languages, lots of copy and paste, remove each screenshot, put a new screenshot.
It literally takes hours, and it drives you crazy.
Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly.

Please provide an API that provides access to the texts to allow developers to implement an application to enable scenarios such as reading or archiving SMS messages.

I'd love to have better and improved reports to improve my app and tune the descriptions of my app store listings (ASO).
For this, I hope you could add the uninstall rate, usage (how often, how long a user uses my app), etc.
Maybe just add the reports Android developers have in the Google Play Store.
Thanks a lot!

Create an option to simulate hardware specs like CPU+GPU.
Dual-core, quad-core, 1.2GHz, 1.5GHz, 2.2GHz, ...

have an exporter for a Adobe XD file that could translate to XAML.
Bonus points for it to be xaml standard compliant
For example:
Let's imagine that you drew a rectangle with yellow rounded corners and added the following text in it "Login", right after you've grouped it, and now you want this to be a button, simply you click convert to button, and then click on toggle For XAML or click show XAML code and copy to clipboard, then you just paste the code in Xamarin.Forms in Visual Studio.
This would make life easier for millions of developers.
In addition, this will allow a greater prominence of XAML Standard, and greater acceptance in the market and in the media.


Torch API doesn't work in Lumia with windows phone 8.1 support such as Lumia 830,640,...
Please update torch driver for these devices, we need use torch for our app's

I love being able to share short text messages quickly by ShareStatusTask.
I want to be able to do the same thing with pictures - i.e.
I want to be able to add a picture to the media library and then start the SharePictureTask to let the user see and share it from the Pictures Hub


Trying to develop a universal Bing Maps app (for Windows Phone and Windows 8 platforms) is a nightmare, due to the vastly different mapping APIs.
They are both doing the same things, but with completely different models.
Can you please choose one model or the other and support it on both platforms?

Make it easier to register for a background task.
Just subscribe for an event (say "PushNotificationReceived" or "UserPresent") and have the app be woken up and the event invoked.
Don't require developers to use the background task builder and background triggers just to activate an app in the background.

Currently the Windows.Management.Deployment.PackageManager is not available for store apps.
Developers would need this functionality if app is valid only for a certain date.

I'd like to show Youtube videos in my app.
This is currently not really possible.
I have to redirect the user to a web site which will then open the YouTube app which will then play the video.
After the video the user has to press back twice to get to my app.
That's annoying.
I would like to have control over the size, positioning and playback of a video.
Others are having the same problem:

Since WebView lacks support for Manipulation Events, it acts as a huge gesture eater which doesn't let its parent controls like ScrollViewer, FlipView to take control of gesture like scroll, swipe etc.
It becomes impossible to use a WebView along with other XAML Elements in the same view.
Manipulation events can help a lot in these situations.

I'm betting on WP7 growing in 2012 - U need to do a MUCH better 'Job' on the TV advertising - I saw the start of the TV advert and said to myself 'Please don't let this be the new WP7 ad ' and sure as heck it was.
My friends know I'm developing for WP7 and the current stuff is embarrasing.
Get that Brandon bloke back !

I need a posibility to set the keyboard language from code.
E.g.
the focus on TextBox1 opens the keyboard with the german layout, the focus on TextBox2 opens the keyboard with a greek layout.
on desktop under net 2.0/3.5 is this no problem:
Windows Forms:
InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage = InputLanguage.FromCulture(new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("ar-EG"))
WPF: (This is exact what i need)
InputLanguageManager.SetInputLanguage(textBox1, new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US"));
InputLanguageManager.SetRestoreInputLanguage(textBox1, true);
I have tested this and it works fine.
If the keyboard is not installed, nothing changes and the current layout remain.
Please implement this, it is important for me for a translation application.

I read that you are considering supporting web apps in Windows 10, using the Edge browser.
I think that's great.
But for it to really work, there are some things you need to do right.
Here's my wish list:
- Implement the existing mozilla "Open Web App" standard.
It works great.
There is no need to reinvent this particular wheel.
- Don't require that I run a windows-based tool to package my app.
In fact, don't require me to "package" the app at all.
I just want to create a manifest and have your browser use that to install.
(See previous wish about Open Web Apps.)
- The easiest way to keep web apps up to date is to use a cache manifest for the offline parts.
But the current defaults for sizes are far too low for real apps.
The best answer would be to simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages.
Give me unlimited offline storage, unlimited numbers of files, unlimited sizes per file.
- Make sure there's a way to install straight from a site, so I don't have to send users to a store to get the app.
- Allow apps to be installed from both IE11 and Edge, even though the apps will use Edge under the covers after being installed.
- Fix the error messages so that when there are problems with cache manifests, they actually tell you want the problems are.
Right now they all just say "Fatal Error" and you have to guess.
- Ensure that if the user is interacting with the application while the cache is downloading, user requests have priority.
Chrome does this.
Firefox does the opposite, which makes the user experience awful during the initial download.
- Give me a way to associate a file extension with a web app in the manifest, so my web app can be the default for that file type.
- Give me a way to associate a custom URI scheme with a web app, so my web app can open when the user clicks a special link in IE11 or Edge
That's it!
You can find most of our desktop apps at m.kaon.com.
You'll see that our customers are your customers.
And our customers would LOVE to be able to install these apps without having to install Firefox or Chrome first.
And I would love to have them use the unbelievably great Edge engine under the covers.

Please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature.

I am using RichTextBox for editing the rtf text.
Initially, if I have rtf text in first line and then after adding bullets to the same line, the bullets does not appears in same color, font and font family.

Hi - you really need to fix the Xbox App store.
We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.
It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox, which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.
Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.
I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device - but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list - making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users.
That is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps - but we released an app last week and currently there are about 2 dozens apps ahead of us - half that won't even work on an Xbox with a controller.
It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.xc2xa0 One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!
You cannot use it, it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.
Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.
At the very least publishing on Xbox should be an opt in function when publishing - not an opt out one.
It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.

This property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario.

Users are asking me frequently for a XBox version of my app.
Unfortunately I do not own a XBox, nor would getting one make sense (it is a free app, so I am not really interested in spending lots of money just for developing purpose.)
Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device, it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time.
It's just the same like with mobile.
Here we have several emulators, and I usually make use of them first instead of plugging a device immediately.
Even more important, XBox has a limited API with respect to desktop and mobile.
(NetworkInformation object not available, etc.)
So testing against a device or emulator is really essential.
Personally I won't enable XBox without having tested my app first - at least in an emulator.
If Microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a PC, then just turn off games.
An app-only emulator would be good enough.

have the possibility to use category of outlook, on wp7 for contact/email/calendar.
using category with filter to see for example all professional contact or all professional rendez-vous...

when a program is pinned to the task bar it would be great if it was sent to the top left when opened, like just next to the show task button.

In SDK give an UI explorer view for Isolated Storage to download, upload isolated storage files from device to desktop.
This will help in testing out and debugging applications which use Isolated storage significantly.

In addition to the existing profiler tool, a network activity profiler should be given so that we can analyse network activities that are happening, potentially helping in troubleshooting cases wheter network activites are becoming bottleneck for app responsiveness.
or to identify amount of network transfer.

Javascript provides a History API with which you can manipulation certain aspects of the browsing history.
For example, history.replaceState() replaces the url of the current website in the browsing history.
However, it is not possible to detect these changes in WebView without injecting javascript to replace the funtion calls.
This solution is quite hacky and a lot of work

What happened to ASTC texture format?
Originally this was supposed to be included in DirectX, but later was scrapped.
Are we going to see it eventually?
Currently I'm using only 2 texture formats:
BC1 - for small size (RGB only)
BC7 - for good quality
While BC7 is great, the BC1 quality is not really good, however we still need small size for textures, as my game is currently over 11 GB of texture data.
From what I see ASTC would be great for that, have good quality but also small size, looks like it has lot of format options, so I could choose what I want.
Why wasn't this added?

Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the "Ink-Keyboard-Overlay".
Would be a lot more intuitive, useful, and less distractive then the current overlay.
Example: Open the Mail-App, write the mail content with the pen directly on the (RichEditBox) canvas, text gets recognised -&gt; Boom done.
Example 2: Open your favorite Todo-App, write a new task with the pen (on canvas), text gets recognised -&gt; Boom done.
The way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win32 ;) I know there is InkCanvas and Windows.UI.Input.Inking.Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way.
(By the way, speech recognition should be handled the same way).
So come on, all the APIs are already there :) Give Windows Ink a boost.

hello,
I belongs to India and want to register my self in Microsoft developer.
I need to pay life time registration fee for this.
when try to pay my fee there is only one option to make payment which is Credit Card.
No more options are there.
I do not have Credit Card therefore unable to make payment.
I request you that please give more payment options for all Indian developers such as Debit Card, Net Banking, PayPal, Skril etc.
I have all these things but does not have only Credit Card and cause of only this minor reason I am unable to make payment.
So, please consider my suggestion and take Decision.
please let me know when you will add more payment options.
Thanks,
Virendra


It would be great if you could add .png support to the medialibrary so that we can save high quality png files to the picture library.

Some apps don't work in background well.
Downloads may breaks when apps switched.
For example, it's better that browser can load a page while i'm switching on another application.
Thank you.

This is basically an extention to GeoFencing and what I would call "Find my friends" kind of apps.
With GeoFencing in place, WP will know the location of every user at any given time.
I would like to have a reminder system (API) that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend (location based).
Example: "Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time".
Having this capability would Windows Phone give the edge of innovation in regards to being people centric.

Please add support of other containers like StackView or RelativePanel for ScrollHeader

For example YASM, GAS(GNU Assembler).
Many native libraries have optimized asm code written in different syntaxes and if(I think with a high probability) VS not support such syntax then if you can rewrite that code or if you can't use slower code and this maybe will be bad for user experience and for battery life.
Currently VS have tools such as armasm which can compile working THUMB code for ARM devices.
But if you want to build, link and rebuild on updates such code together with your application then you must to create custom build tool.
The question here is: "Why developer not have buil-in tools to do that?".
And even if you will create such build tool then you will be not able(or I'm don't know how to do it) to debug such source files.
And of course no highlighting, no intellisense is available which can highly help to develop in asm.
Also you can ask "Why I need to use asm when I have intrinsic functions?"
and my answer will be "Because it's faster(up to 2x) and much more predicatable(because I have no guarantee that compiler will generate better code than I can write by hands or code that is already exists) than intrinsics.
".

It's great to introduce an Edge Browser into a UWP application via the WebView.
It would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the DOM that is in the currently loaded page of the WebView control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary.
There have been many DOM APIs created in MSFT's history, so it's now time to build another one.
:)


In .appxmanifest files, the &lt;Application&gt; element supports $targetnametoken$ and $targetentrypoint$ variables, which the Windows Application Package Project uses in its template .appxmanifest file.
The &lt;desktop:Extension&gt; element, however, does not, which leads to some guessing as to what the Executable attribute should be.
The documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.startuptask#desktop-bridge-app-startup-task-extension does say what the EntryPoint should be, but in packages generated by the Windows Application Package Project, putting just the executable name in for the Executable attribute results in an error, because the generated package puts the executable in a subfolder with the same name as the solution.
For example, a correct .appxmanifest that uses the desktop:StartupTask extension looks like
```XML
&lt;Application Id="MyApp" Executable="$targetnametoken$.exe" EntryPoint="$targetentrypoint$"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;Extensions&gt;
    &lt;desktop:Extension Category="windows.startupTask" Executable="MyAppMyApp.exe" EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication"&gt;
      &lt;desktop:StartupTask TaskId="MyAppStartupTask" Enabled="false" DisplayName="My app" /&gt;
    &lt;/desktop:Extension&gt;
  &lt;/Extensions&gt;
&lt;/Application&gt;
Note that I had to specify the executable in two different ways.
I'd like to be able to just write:
```XML
&lt;Application Id="MyApp" Executable="$targetnametoken$.exe" EntryPoint="$targetentrypoint$"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;Extensions&gt;
    &lt;desktop:Extension Category="windows.startupTask" Executable="$targetnametoken$" EntryPoint="$targetentrypoint$"&gt;
      &lt;desktop:StartupTask TaskId="MyAppStartupTask" Enabled="false" DisplayName="My app" /&gt;
    &lt;/desktop:Extension&gt;
  &lt;/Extensions&gt;
&lt;/Application&gt;

I have a Windows 10 notebook with a second screen.
And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another.
I just figured out what was the problem and I can work with it without any problem, but I want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user.
How to emulate the bug
  - Open windows explorer:
  - resize the windows explorer window to something like 300px to 300px
  - maximize the window
  - Now with the mouse pointer, click on the title of the window and move it to the second screen.
the problem that I get, is that the window will flash and crash, the solution is to close it in the taskbar, restart the explorer process.
To fix it, just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen, and then maximize it again.
Then, when you move the screen it will not have the same problem.

I believe that everyone in XAML lovers, we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.
These are widely used in the real world today.
In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes, visual programming, animation software, single/multitracks audio editors, video editors, slide editors, photo gallery, websites, social networks among many others.
# TimelineView Control
&lt;TimelineView Name="Timeline1" Length="05:00:00:0000" TimeCountDisplay="Timecode or AudioBeat or Frame"&gt;
    &lt;AudioGroupe or ElementGroupe or ItemGroupe&gt;

This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site, but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform.

I currently develop for Android and iOS.
I am interested in developing for Windows Phone, but would need a device, to pay registration and learn a 3rd platform to do so.
That involves a lot of time, which is a large risk to smaller development companies.
If Microsoft created some incentives, like a free device (Blackberry did this) and a free year of membership (Amazon did this) it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off.
I would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for Windows Phone if Microsoft created incentives for me to try the platfrom.

Please make the new prerelease APIs from namespace Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators (e.g.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.networking.networkoperators.mobilebroadbandantennasar) available to Windows 10 Mobile Feature Release 2 (10.0.152xx .0).

Windows 8.1 SDK brought a lot of built in transitions, making easier to develop a native-like app.
But I'm missing that list animations seen on Settings or Messaging apps when opening or closing them.
There are properties like IsStaggeringEnabled and IsStaggerElement in the CommonNavigationInfo class, but the animations doesn't feel like the native one.
Thanks and keep up the good work with Windows Phone!

The idea of background agents expiring if they have not been 're-initialized' in two weeks makes sense.
However, in some scenarios they do not make sense.
We have a company hub app that is downloaded after mdm enrollment, this hub app uses a background task to post back some device info and location which is not available through the mdm protocol.
There is no user interaction here, so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario.
The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the app.

Subscribers of the BackRequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order.
Currently, a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation.
Example: In the UWP Community Toolkit the MasterDetailsView  control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle "navigating" back when in a collapsed state with selection.
The only work around I found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in the shell when the page has loaded.
This gave the MasterDetailsView the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it.
In other projects/frameworks like Template 10 this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the BackRequested event first.

I was working on clipboard manager application for windows 8, and discovered that there is no way to catch Clipboard.ContentChanged event when application is running in background, seems the life cycle of WinRT app doesn't allow this.
Wish I would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event.
Thank you.

I have posted my 1st application on windows store, with 9 keywords.
However none of the keywords seems to be working.
I believe its a defect.
I raised this in dev support but I am asked to add this issue here.
Kindly look into the issue.
Also would like to mention that I have Matching word in my application name.
I was expecting that if people search for Match then also it should work, but unfortunately it seems to be searching whole word.
I would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also, or may be give an advance search option, where people can tell where the word should be searched.
For eg in publisher name or in application name, whole word, partial word and so on.

I've done some tests, and to my surprise DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD instead of bringing performance improvements, it slows things down.
Nvidia GeForce 650m GT, latest videos drivers (April/May 2017)
Windows 10, latest updates (May 2017)
DirectX 11 API
I've made a simple application, all it did was just clear the backbuffer several times and presented the screen.
In v-sync mode, I've cleared it more times, to get below 60 fps limit.
Win32/WinAPI Results:
windowed, sync=false
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_DISCARD             850 fps
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD        655 fps
windowed, sync=true
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_DISCARD             42 fps
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD        34 fps
fullscreen, sync=true
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_DISCARD             16.9 fps
DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD        16.4 fps
I've done the same tests in UWP mode, using DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD and results were the same slow as in Win32/WinAPI.
Why are you limiting UWP and DirectX12 to flip mode that is slower?

Since Application insights for mobile is discontinued soon, the dev center analytics will be broken.

Live tiles are fine, but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template.
In a similar way to the new lock-screen apps, allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre-defined tile sizes.
The app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them.
For example, I could create a mail widget which shows me the 3 most recent messages and when I tap it's UI, I can take some action on the item that received the touch input.
Basically, look at android widgets.
They got it right and provides for limitless customization.
These would be real live tiles, not the current "dead bitmap" that is updated every so often we call a live tile.

I am suggesting a new control with following features.
1. a type of Horizontal one row ListView/GridView.
2.
Only Horizontal Scrolling available because its one row only
3.
Scrolling/Navigation Buttons, on right side next button on left side of the control will be a previous button.
Next/Previous Behaviour : the available screen will show the max number of items in the row of the control according to size of the control and size of the items in it.
When the user will press button for next items, then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the screen.
Next and previous buttons will look like FlipView Control, but FlipView only shows one item at a time but this control will show multiple items according to the available size, and each item would be selectable and clickable, just like a normal ListView Control.
Example : Best example is the youtube homepage has this control, where suggested videos from different channels are shown in single row.
with buttons on each side

Would like to see an improvement in MapPolyLine that allows multiple Individual Segments that have there own properties i.e.
for example, once you add a location to MapPolyLine Instance, that becomes a segment, I should then be able to control the look and feed such as Color of the stroke for that segment of the MapPolyLine.
Currently Changing the stroke changes the color for the entire line regardless of how many locations are added to the line.
Also would like the ability to make the Line a 3d gradient shape to have it pop out more on the map control.

Allow other formats than PCM and float for a FrameOutputNode created with CreateFrameOutputNode of class AudioGraph.
Other Formats like MP3 or OGG would be nice.
One Scenario is that of a shoutcast source for Internet Radio streaming.
A shoutcast source transmits MP3 data via TCP to a shoutcast Server.
If a FrameOutputNode would allow to get the encoded MP3 data then that data could easily transmitted via a TCP Stream.
Currently I have to save a MP3 stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP.
This burden would be eliminated would MP3 Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode.

We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.
We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.
In debug mode, it all works fine.
In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.
The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp)
We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block
Hope this issue lands in the priority list of Microsoft.
For now, we have no option but to re-build the app to a non-Microsoft environment.

Just like the user can select apps that are allowed to run in the background, it would be great if they could select apps that are allowed to change phone settings.
For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits.

WinRT is littered with Async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases.
They are a welcome *addition* to the API, but they should not be the *only* way to obtain data.
When I've already created a dedicated thread anyway off the main UI for processing, I don't need nor want WinRT API's spawn even more threads.
From now onward, please add Sync() methods first, and optionally add supplementary Async() method for long operations.
Although the intentions of increased threading throughput are respectable, focus on writing API's that are foremost developer friendly.
Remember Steve Balmer - "developers, developers, developers".

The DataTransferManager.TargetApplicationChosen event never fires in a WinRT 8.1 app for the phone (universal app).
At best, this causes a loss of UX quality in some cases.
In the case of Tap to Share, its absence is problematic, since the app has no way of telling whether to use ProximityDevice and PeerFinder to implement the function.
Always implementing the NFC sharing regardless can make for a clumsy user interface.
The documentation says this event is supported for the phone -- this claim is false as of this writing.

When using Windows.Media.Transcoding.MediaTranscoder to transcode ALAC file to something else, it reports "CodecNotFound".
However ALAC decoding is supported according to this page https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/supported-codecs#desktop .
More interestingly, transcoding other files to ALAC works fine.

My internet explorer has stopped working

Hello!
I using Windows UI Library (Preview).
After some project rebuilds i got error DEP0500: Cannot remove folder "D:SourcesOneExplorerPackagebinx86DebugAppX".
UnauthorizedAccessException - Access denied to "Microsoft.UI.Xaml.winmd".
[0x80070005]
I can build my project again only after restarting the Visual Studio.

I'd suggest to include all Transactions in the Report.
or at least distinct records (different taxes, sales Price, date time).
Currently an evaluation which Downloads were billed at which Price is not possible.

Allow rotation/scaling of MapIcons so that they stick relative to when the map is rotated.
As an example, I place an MapIcon at a particular Lat/Long the rotate that MapIcon 156 deg.
As the map is rotated the icon mains it;s relative rotation to the map.
Prefer that i could stream  XAML or other vector as MapIcon source to it will scale correctly.
Also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue.

I'd like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker.
Right now, there's no easy way to automate their download and parsing.
An HTTP-based API with a program-friendly logon (e. g. OAuth) would be most welcome.

1.
Attach devices to another and ensure it full loading
2, Hot plug device to unit and idle about 1min
3.
Hot unplug and wait about 30s
4.
Re-plug again

Found BSOD(0xe6) occurred.FR:1/50
I have chick bug code 0xe6 is DRIVER_VERIFIER_DMA_VIOLATION.
I use driver verifier to see what happen, but when restart, where did I find my log file or result.And how to fix it .
From dump file.
I can see it relative with USBXHCI.But I have no idea.

Think about the future fiber network speed, the upcoming 5G cellular network, ultra fast network is coming.
But the modern WinRT network API which is based around StreamSocket, and the corresponding StreamSocketControl do not provide an option to enable TCP timestamps support.
Which is not future-proof.
Yes, I know if we're C++ developers, we can use the traditional Winsock API, setsockopt() can do what we need, but that will tied us to the old self-manage threads model, which is not pleasing.
So, please add TCP timestamps option support to the StreamSocketControl class.
RFC7323 tells the story in much greater detail.

A container for starting applications inside it on Windows 10 IoT Core, instead of full-screen.
This would allow creating launchers that have on-screen navigation bar and other contextual controls.

The current USB API is lacking the ability to specify which USB Port Number to use, rather than the device VendorID/ProductID.
My situation:
I have two identical USB Zebra printers and cannot tell them apart.

I am working in multinational company.I wan to use lock screen as share point for actual news , social activities.How we can make this?

I am developing a Windows Phone 8.1 application using windows xaml and c#.
And the app needed to sync users phone contacts with the server.
So at the point , We need to get all contacts from the phone and have to send it to the server.
But compared to Silver light version contact api performance is really poor and it takes mare time to load all contacts.
Please consider my suggestion on this case
1.
Polish your new Contact Manager api to get the maximum performance .Hence the user not to sit idle till it loads.
2.
I could not find the filter option when querying contacts.
It may be based on number only contacts, contacts with email address, or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc.
I don't think supposed changes are difficult to implement.
Microsoft is trying to do and provide new thing .
But they are always neglecting such a simple functionalities.
If you concentrate to give such simple things , you might get some good results and happy customers *** developers.
Hope you people will make it !
!
Cheers..

It would be great to be able to use the WP8 emulator (and Surface emulator for that matter) for mobility demonstrations, i.e.
when I deliver a Dynamics CRM demo I often (nearly always) want to include mobility scenarios on the same screen as the rest of the demo.
Using the actual hardware is okay for an in-person demo but the form factor isn't ideal to demonstrate the functionality to the whole room.
It's no good at all for remote demos.
The emulators would be a great way to achieve this, but it would require:
1) The ability to install downloaded apps from the store onto the emulator (e.g.
Resco CRM)
2) In order to achieve the point 1, the ability to connect to the store with my Microsoft account
Thanks,
Justin

Behind the portal, the user could control which microphones the Lumia would use to circumvent the bug affecting the Lumias 930 Brazilians.

Files created with DownloadsFolder.CreateFileAsync cannot be loaded by the full path name with StorageFile.GetFileFromPathAsync.
This doesn't really make sense as the documentation states, "All apps can create files and folders in the Downloads folder and can access the files that they create".
Attempting to do this results in the following error:
Exception thrown: 'System.UnauthorizedAccessException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll
WinRT information: Cannot access the specified file or folder (C:Users{Username}Downloads{PackageName}_y356m3t891zm4!App{FileName}.pdf).
The item is not in a location that the application has access to (including application data folders, folders that are accessible via capabilities, and persisted items in the StorageApplicationPermissions lists).
Verify that the file is not marked with system or hidden file attributes.
This is a detriment to cross-platform APIs that use strings to pass paths around.
For example, a file downloader API may return the path to the download and a separate file launcher API may open the download via the full path.
Maintaining the IStorageFile reference returned from CreateFileAsync should not be necessary to retain access rights.

Premier Enterprise customers who use Dev Center to publish LOB enterprise apps on their Private store have an erratic support experience.
When submitting a ticket it does not allow them to use their Enterprise IDs to submit a ticket, so a dev center admin with a enterprise id @contso.com is not able to login and dev center forces to choose a personal account originally linked to Dev center to submit an incident.
This needs to be changed so Enterprise customers can open a support incident

Developers tend to work within one framework (UWP/WPF/ASP/etc) at a time.
It would be extremely useful (time saving) if the Docs site had a saved filter setting for this that helped restrict search results, API browsing, etc.
I think a lot of users waste a lot of time finding themselves browsing some Docs site page which turns out to not be applicable to their development framework.
For example, I keep wasting time browsing through search result pages that turn out to be for WPF when I'm doing UWP development, and it's common for that to not be entirely clear at the time.
At the same time, having all the Docs site pages show at the top which frameworks/platforms they're applicable to would be extremely useful -- and links to equivalent pages for other frameworks/platforms would be extremely useful.

The base Contact fields should match the available fields in MS Outlook.
The don't even come close.
I switched from Android (using CompanionLink software) and it is far better.
I can't think of an Outlook Contact field that wasn't available.
Had I known that I would not have mobile access to this important information for my business, I would have remained with Android.
Seeing as how this is a MS product and software, also, I find it surprisingly disappointing.
Calendar entries are far too basic, too.

If my mobile is part of a PBX I need to transfer calls between another phones on the PBX.
Nowadays there is not any feature to make call forwarding / call divert once I hace pick up the incoming call.

This is a control that I use quite frequently in my LoB applications which I can see being something that is used across other applications.
I have an implementation that I'm more than happy to provide.

Please provide an API where one can query for any system information or device info data.
Its currently spilled all over the system into a bunch of unrelated APIs, Registry, and files.
WMI exposes it, but its just simply, an awful way to retrieve the basic info in a modern ecosystem.
The *nix ecosystem handles it beautifully with the "proc" filesystem.
Windows unfortunately has no equivalent of it, and is a nightmare for developers, unless they know exactly which APIs or Registry Keys to look for.


We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.
On a touch screen, this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox.
Repro steps:
1) Create a new "Blank App" UWP project
2) Add the XAML below to MainPage.xaml
3) Build and run the app
4) Before doing anything else, click the "Show touch keyboard" button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.
5) See that the touch keyboard is the NumericPin keyboard, even though the focused TextBox should have the default InputScope.
6) Click into TextBox 2.
7) See that the touch keyboard is still NumericPin, even though it should be EmailSmtpAddress
8) Click into the PasswordBox.
Keyboard remains NumericPin.
9) Click into TextBox 1 or TextBox 2.
10) See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored.
&lt;StackPanel Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}" Margin="100"&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Header="Normal TextBox 1" Width="300" /&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Header="Normal TextBox 2" Width="300"  InputScope="EmailSmtpAddress"/&gt;
        &lt;PasswordBox
            Width="300"
                Margin="2,10,2,0"
                InputScope="NumericPin"
                Header="PasswordBox" /&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;

Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points, then re-run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission.
Would also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.

Need to support APIs to access POS peripheral devices through background tasks
Use case to be achieved-

We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK.
Why is the same not possible for the pre-release SDK?
On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025, but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing.
I am not willing to go to fast ring, because this renders my laptop useless.
I tried.
So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs, where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs.

It would be great if you make it easy to connect to host PC localhost (to consume a web-service for example) instead of going through lengthy process (http://blogs.iis.net/robert_mcmurray/archive/2013/08/20/connecting-the-windows-phone-8-emulator-to-web-api-applications-on-a-local-computer.aspx) and maybe figure out later that this also doesn't work in your case; e.g., using a domain-joined PC.

Currently, the only way to have a Panel scroll smoothly is to use the ScrollViewer.
However, because the ScrollViewer uses the Direct Manipulation API, you cannot feed manipulation events down to any child controls as they are getting totally absorbed within Direct Manipulation code inside ScrollViewer.
Therefore, if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a Vertical scrolling ScrollViewer (for a custom ListView Item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example) it simply cannot be done.
Once your scrolling, nothing else inside can react to user input.
Can you not simply pass manipulation delta information to child elements within the ScrollViewer ?
It seems completely crazy that I simply cannot implement a fairly ordinary UI behaviour available on other platforms in Windows Phone 8.1 /WinRT

Downloading from the web is a very common thing to do in Apps but it doesn't have any dedicated control for it.

2.
Download.GetInfo.Name, Download.GetInfo.Size, ... to get the Info about the item to be Downloaded
3.
Download.Start, Download.Pause, Download.Stop
4.
Download.GetPercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating ProgessBar
5.
Download.GetSpeed to get the download speed
6.

Please enable removing language code from the Dev Center "language history"
For example if you ever selected "ru" and "ru-ru" laguages and you published this xap to the Store then it causes Tile localization to show the en-us(default) tile localization which is bad.
Note: in your .csproj file, there is a SupportedCultures entry like this:
&lt;SupportedCultures&gt;de-DE;ru;ru-RU
&lt;/SupportedCultures&gt;
When I removed the "ru" language code and published my new xap version, the old xap version still remains in the Store with "Replaced and unpublished".
Wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious problems:
1.
Some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app.
The store randomly gives the old xap or the new xap version of my app.
2.
My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP in the same submission.
The wp7 xap works only on WP7 and the wp8 xap works only for WP8.
Sometimes the Store gives the wrong wp7 xap version of my app to Windows Phone 8 users.
It should be an option to remove the "ru" language code from my app 'language History' or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s).
Currently if you ever mistakenly selected a "ru" language than you will be in a very bad situation forever:
 - You can live with the wrong Tile displayed for Russian language in the Store (the english one) or
 - You can publish an update with the removed "ru" language, but this update will not "fully replace" the old version and you will in truble: 1.)
&amp; 2.
): the store will randomly deliver the old/wrong version of your xap.
I write a lot support ticket on this, but no one really cares on this issue.
The engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following:
1.
Provide a workaround for removing the "ru" language from the language history (I have no need for "ru" culture just for "ru-ru", but there is no way to remove "ru" from the language history if you ever posted your app with "ru" language support)
2.
Or add and implement an AppResLib.dll.xxxx.mui for the "ru" language culture
 In the documentation AppResLib.dll.xxxx.mui exist only for "ru-ru" and not for "ru" culture: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff967550(v=vs.105).aspx
Thanks,

There is no category specifically related to science apps; I think having such a category would provide a more refined ability to find such an app in the Store.
The closest category (the one I'm using) is Education.
Here are a couple of examples: I can envision a mobile app that is a "Tree Finder" that provides the ability to identify a tree genus/species by selecting from an imagery collection, or an Astronomical app that provides ephemeris data (position of sun, moon, planets, etc), in a graphical format.
My particular application locates earthquakes on a map and allows the user to receive additional detail.

The ability to broadcast and bind sockets to a port would be handy for making local client &lt;=&gt; server applications where you don't need to specify the server IP.

It's a lot easier to build a following when it's free.
Keeping this in mind, was thinking of making some of my products donationware.
Would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store?
The ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free.
Donations should be supported

Having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the  vendor is a nice idea.
However, if an IT tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms, the enrollment experience is then totally different.
We would like to make the enrollment process consistent for our users.
Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app, or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.

We can see the support of communities in UWPCommunityToolkit.
It would be nice to have a UWP(or Xamarin) Community Tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date.

In WP8, the default Pivot control  now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the PhoneFontFamilySemiBold and PhoneFontSizeMedium styles, but the standard "blank" page template still uses PhoneTextNormalStyle (which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size) for the page title.
These page templates should be updated to use the medium-sized, semibold font by default for the title text.
This change would encourage consistency with both the apps built-in to the OS and within an app itself.
This should also be fixed in the WP7 SDK (where all page templates, including the Pivot template, still use PhoneTextNormal style for the title).

Provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only.
This facility exist for public store apps, but not LOB ones.

In Windows Store, the longer app's titles or capitalized app's titles, for example "COBATA (X)HTML Constructor", are cut to 14-15 characters doing the app's title meaningless, for example "COBATA (X)HTML".
It is because the responsible HTML element c-heading class font-size style property is fixed to 15px.
Please, revise that value to 12px, or provide better representation solution.

We need a way to save videos to the camera roll.
The leak of a MediaLibrary.SaveVideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user.

There are situations, where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page, when using NavigationView.
Say you throw up a message box a la "Do you want to save the changes" "Yes/No/Cancel", if you were to click Cancel, there's no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually.
Say you have two menu items, one Home and the other Whatever.
If you're at the page Whatever, click on Home, a message box shows up and you click Cancel (to stop the app from navigating away), the NavigationView will move its highlight to the Home menu item regardless of whatever happens.
There's no sane way to do it, e.g.
a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event.
An example for this would be this budgeting app I'm currently working on.
If you're editing a transaction, but haven't committed it, trying to navigate away, I'd like to throw up a "Save Changes?"
message box with the typical Yes/No/Cancel options.
I can't deal with the Cancel action, without code voodoo trying to revert the SelectedItem ASAP.
Thanks for considering changing this.

Current behavior of SystemTrigger.UserAway and UserPresent is unexpected.
1.
Phone is sleeping with screen turned off
2.
Some event occurs (SMS, Incoming Call, Toast)
3.
Screen turning on
4.
UserNotificationChangedTrigger fired
5.
UserPresent trigger fired
6.
After some short timeout screen goes off
7.
UserAway trigger fired
All that happens without any real user attendance which makes those triggers useless.
In WM5/6 there was an UNATTENDED power state for that situation and there was a way to detect real user interaction with the device.
My suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on Lock/Unlock transitions.

Please extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate, AddedDate.

It is really sad that I cannot just grab my phone, go to file explorer and tap on a video I want to play that is on my local network.
This is ridiculous.
Also and perhaps more importantly developers need this!
Do you know how many hoops I have to jump though to make an app that simply takes photos and puts them on a network location... Too many.
With SMB support any developer could connect to a remote file share via URI (eg.
servernamesharesub-folder) and then authenticate using remote server credentials and just like that you have enabled many more applications to get made.
It is crazy that such basic functionality is not currently supported, almost every device on the planet supports this other than windows phone.
What makes this even more important is the fact that it IS already supported in UWP apps when they are running on desktop, laptops and tablets.
But the same file picker on phone is just missing this "Universal" functionality...

Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystem does not provide meaningful data for Xbox.
The state is always Unknown (when the watcher triggers Added or Updated event).
And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.
When adding a StatusFilter for Available, Xbox is never shown.
This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because it's totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.
Nevertheless, if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher, the app is at least started correctly.
Nevertheless, user experience is very bad if the device state is always unknown upfront.

I have a bar-code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port.

Kiosk mode for business users is a great idea.
However when an app is running in Kiosk mode, the update process is unstructured/uncontrolled.
It would be great for a permanently running app to have an API which notifies it when an update is available, to notify when an update is forced, to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update.
This would enable the user to be told when an update is available and allow them (or the app) to schedule the update.
E.g.
in a production system there may be better times to control the update in-app.

ApplicationView has AdjacentToLeftDisplayEdge and AdjacentToRightDisplayEdge.
Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge, too ?
Benefit: A work around to detect when application is maximize ( not fullscreen ) on desktop.

Manually checking for the latest updates, the message ' up to date, last check 2 seconds ago' will be displayed.
Will I know, that the last check was 2 second s ago, so a message ' it is up to date' will be enough.
The timeframe of the last check should only be shown when the update check has been done automatically.

Some BLE devices request changing MTU while communicating through GATT.
It would be useful if this feature can be supported in Windows 10

The current implementation of MarkupExtension in UWP is hardly usable as it is.
And some implementation choices are unfortunate.
My proposal:
    1.
A GetTarget() function should be added to MarkupExtension.
Because ProvideValue() does not give any way to retrieve the target control and property.
Knowing the XAML Control and property that have instantiated the markup extension is essential in many, if not most, scenarios.
Please note WPF let retrieve this information.
    2.
For the class that inherit MarkupExtension, the constructor parameters should be taken into consideration by the XAML interpreter.
In order to be able to write things like:
Property="{MyMarkupExtension param1 param2}"
    3.
We should have an interface in complement to the class:
IMarkupExtension
That is essential here to be able for the class to inherit both from DependencyObject and from IMarkupExtension, in order to have the opportunity to set bindings in the class property.
    4.
By the way, Binding should inherit the proposed interface IMarkupExtension.
    5.
By the way again, the XAML interpreter should accept classes that inherit Binding.
It is useful when setting default Converters, for example.
    6.
It should be good to have an interface IDependencyObject.
Public and accepted by the XAML interpreter.
    7.
There should a way for a function called by x:Bind to retrieve the target control and property.
    8.
About Binding, the name scope can be a nightmare.
Why a DependencyObject can not give its name scope ?
We could have an interface called INameScope that let any class implement a FindName(), similar to FrameWorkElement.FindName().
    9.
That would perfect to be able to set a binding in a binding, and a binding in a  MarkupExtension.
Example: Property="{MyMarkupExtension xe2x80x98helloxe2x80x99, xe2x80x98{Binding ...}xe2x80x99, xe2x80x98x:Bind ...xe2x80x9d}"
And "{Binding X, ElementName=xe2x80x99{Binding xe2x80xa6.
}xe2x80x99}"
    10.
Do I have to talk about WPFxe2x80x99s MultiBinding ?
In short, some difficulties and blocking scenarios come from the implementation of some classes in XAML/UWP.
And some from the XAML interpreter that refuse many things, as logical and obvious are these things.
The mono-inheritance of C#/.NET is a very good reason to use interfaces everywhere they can be used.
I believe the most common classes, mostly the classes that are susceptible to be inherited, should be accompanied by an interface, and the functions, properties and fields should always use the interface prior to a class type.
As a motivation, let me tell you that writing a markup extension today is very frustrating.
Please develop less new not-so-essential features and concentrate more on the consolidation of the framework.

Since the 8.1, the MediaElement (Silverlight for sure, maybe RT?)
seekbar make a noise 'plop!'
when you change the position in a video,  even when the sound of the phone is muted, and it's very unpleasant.
I thought you'll corrected in the last 8.1 update but it seems you don't the existence of this bug...
The bug is on every Nokia Lumia I own (620/1020/1520)
All the best.

I'd like it if once I have an app that has been published using my msn account.
That the store would realize that it was my account and allow me to download it, as a trial (which would always start from the date I download it), if I uninstalled it and re-installed it would still show as trial.
Then would let me test the purchasing as well (which would then switch the license temporarily for say 24hours or that run of the app).
This would allow me to test that everything is working properly with the store live.
Also I'd like the rating of the app to allow me as the developer to respond back to the end user (ideally emailing them and or posting it online) And allow them to correspond with me to try and resolve any issues (whether that is with Microsoft being a proxy or whatever makes sense).
 I've had a few complaints about trial expiring when people first download the app.
Which sucks as it's out of my control.

Well,many country doesn't have visa card availability.So the only way we can have international transactions is via prepaid visa card.So ms should support prepaid card for dev account registration.Or atleast ms should state in the registration form that you dont support prepaid card for developer account.

When the StrokeDashArray property is defined as a Setter in a XAML Style, it is only applied to the first element on the page to use that Style.
Other elements on the page ignore the StrokeDashArray property as defined in the Style.
This problem also occurs if the Style is applied -- and when it's RE-applied -- in the code-behind at run-time.
This problem also occurs with new elements created at run-time using the Style.

CalcBinding is an advanced Binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in XAML, without custom converters.
CalcBinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion, inverse your expression and more.
CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user-friendly.
This is only available for WPF - https://github.com/Alex141/CalcBinding
Here are some examples
&lt;Label Content="{c:Binding A+B+C }" /&gt;
&lt;Label Content="{c:Binding A*0.5+(B.NestedProp1/C - B.NestedProp2 % C) }" /&gt;
&lt;Button Background="{c:Binding '(A &gt; B ?
media:Brushes.LightBlue : media:Brushes.White)'}"/&gt;
&lt;TextBox Text="{c:Binding 'Math.Sin(Math.Cos(A))'}"/&gt;
&lt;Button Visibility="{c:Binding !IsChecked}" /&gt;
&lt;c:Binding 'A and B or C' /&gt;

When a payment is being processed, my "proceeds since last payment" drops by the amount I'm going to be paid.
However I don't know how long the money will arrive in my account.
It has been over a week now and I am still guessing.
My suggestion is that when a payment is being processed, this should be indicated on the Financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed.
I would suggest you look into AdMob/AdSense reporting for inspiration as it's very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible.

How to use the ThemeShadow in UWP?
the documentation does give a clear instruction, something must be missing here.

It would be nice to see Windows Phone move to optional vector based icons instead of static bitmaps.
This would allow the application bar (or appbar) to resize if say HD screens were added.
Ideally, users would only need 2 icons for the marketplace: 'Tile' (contains the application name), and 'List' (just the icon for the app list).
Appbars could be created at 48x48 and resized as needed.
I know this is a pain on developers that are not designers or have designers, but an option would be nice time saver for the future.
Currently I know of developers creating deep link tiles from XAML in their application, so the idea isn't too far off.
This came up while talking to other developers at a few talks/meetups (not because I created the largest vector based creative commons icon pack for Windows Phone that many of you use already).

Please add a delegate version for the PropertyMetadata.Create where the DependencyProperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value.
That way you can for example create default values for dependency properties that is requires information from other dependecy objects or resource.
For example, lets say I want to create shorthand for aligning a control inside RelativePanel fully horizontal like AlignHorizontalWithPanel.
Now I can create an attached property and assume it is already false and set that to the default, however if I would like to check beforehand if the dependencyobject it will be assigned with has the AlignLeftWithPanel and AlignRightWithPanel already true or not so that the default is proper.

Make the wallet app back to where it was I miss putting notes on the accounts and miss the bar codes
And in other feedback anyway to get Cortina to read emails too?

When using MapElement derived controls, such as MapPolygon, expose a Tap event.
In the event arguments allow some type of identification of the backing object -- such as the Tag property.
Or don't make these objects sealed, so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves.

When using the LaunchUriAsync opens the uri too slow making users think applications do not work and clicking/tapping several times and then get confronted with an app or browser opening several times.

It would be nice to use rating control with partial stars.
Example:
https://imgur.com/a/SoHMsyd
It can be a Step property.
For example: Step = 0.5 and MaxValue = 5.
Thanks!

I just noticed problems with this on mobile today.
DailyPic, a App I use to changed my background, is affected by this.
When ever I have my screen set to Tile Picture Mode, it reverts it back to Full screen mode.
Pretty annoying!

The WebClient type doesn't allow me to use cookies stored by the Web Browser control and I'll have to ask the user for credentials which they've already stored in the form of cookies through the login page of a particular site in the web browser.
There is an indirect way of using BrowserHttp but it's kinda buggy.
It's not exposed by the SDK, please fix it!

As a developer, I create submissions for my apps.
Ensuring my app has correct Age Ratings is an important step of this process.
In the Age Ratings area, I'm told my "Current Rating ID" is 4544c68c-6026-433b-be71-e662dd2f88e4.
I don't know what that means.
I hope it's right.

why shouldn't I as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries?
?
Here in Denmark there aren't that many wp users yet, so a lot of apps will show up in the marketplace without any reviews, -even though you can see in apptracker that there exist some reviews...

Make .Net available on all platforms(including Mac, Linux, all Smartphones).
Developers like me, like C# style coding and hate HTML, XML, XAML Javascrip and CSS.
So, please expand winforms so that legacy app developers can develop for newer platforms and easily make apps available for newer devices(and can port their winform apps to mobile and tabs easily).
Microsoft instead of developing upon existing technologies is too hasty to bring out new ones.
This brings up a huge learning curve for developers.
Eg.
Microsoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into .net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead, now how will a developer who has invested lots of his time in learning NHibernate has to now restart with EntityFramework.
We as developers have to constantly learn new techs rather than solving problems.
We are always in a fear regarding when Microsoft might bring out something new and will forget about existing technologies and all our hard work put into mastering those technologies goes down the drain.

In WPF, there is a "low level" DrawingContext API, which allows highly intensive graphics rendering without producing tons of (shape) objects each with its layout step.
It would be nice to have such an API in WinRT, so we don't have to resort to native DirectX each time we need something more than a couple of shapes.

Add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios.
See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239)

SSDP (used in UPnP) relies on UDP multicast for discovery.
Currently UdpAnySourceMulticastClient allows for the listening to existing SSDP traffic, as well as sending a solicitation (M-SEARCH) out requesting that UPnP devices advertise themselves to the solicitor.
When a device replies to the M-SEARCH message it sends a unicast message to the IP &amp; port that the M-SEARCH message was sent from.
There is no way for a WP7 application using UdpAnySourceMulticastClient or Socket to listen on the correct port, thus requiring a great deal of time to be spent in any UPnP application when doing device discovery.
Proper socket support, a fixed UdpAnySourceMulticastClient implementation, or an explicit SSDP client which supports sending &amp; handling replies to M-SEARCH messages should be enabled.

The current implementation of the Http*Content classes exposed by the Windows.Web.Http namespace do not allow adding Custom headers to the Http "content".
If developers need to create a request with multiple instances of MIME content (e.g.
an email and an attachment), they need a capability to add the Content-Transfer-Encoding and Content-ID headers to each of the mime contents.
Currently this is not possible because when trying to add custom Headers to the content using the below code:
HttpMultipartContent mpContent = new HttpMultipartContent();
mpContent.Headers.Add("Content-Transfer-Encoding", "8bit");
we first check to see if the headers which are trying to be added are "well known headers".
Since the above code does not set a "well known header", the above code results in an exception: "Misused header name.
Make sure request headers are used with HttpRequestMessage, response headers with HttpResponseMessage, and content headers with HttpContent objects."
This idea tracks the request to enable setting such headers in the Windows.Web.Http.Http*Content types.

The LaunchUriForResultsAsync method works fine.
But we can't change the size of the window that is opened.
It is always 500x500.
We need to open the window as maximized.
This prevents us from using this API.
Please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the LaunchUriForResultsAsync method.

In UWP you can inject an object into the WebView as a global parameter with AddWebAllowedObject

Currently an in-process appservice can be invoked without actually launching the main app ui.
However once a user launch the main app ui and close it, appservice is also terminated (because both shared same process).
It must be possible to only unload Main UI out of the process without terminating the app service.

The date drop down in the Windows Dev Center needs to have custom date so the developers can see the total download of their application of any interval they enter.
At the moment that is limited to 12 months.

Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India, browser should start displaying Indian language characters.

Using x:Bind or Binding in a Setter Value property of a VisualState will not be executed at the start of the view, you have to change the state of the and then go back before the bindings are used resulting in initial views being broken.

Allow changing of volume in the Windows Device Portal.
eg.
I'd use this for my media phone playing Groove 24/7.

As a user, I would like to be able to select songs that I have put on the device (from my library) to wake up to.
As a developer, I can only allow the user to choose from songs that I included with the app.
The main work-around I've seen in the various alarm clock apps is to force the user to keep the app open over night which is not particularly awesome for battery life.

Presently, one cannot print in UWP without invoking the print dialog.
This hinders automation in the creation of PDFs.
Why not allow the creation of PDFs without print dialog interaction?

It would be really cool if developers could get api access to Xbox Live Gamertags, that way they don't have to make users create a new account just to play multiplayer games.
It would also help a lot for leaderboards too.

Please implement possibility for developer to handle (popup) window user flow.

Today there is a handler for NewWindowRequested to create new window, but there seems to be no way to handle window.close() call from javascript for example.

Music app can provide to its users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming, UPnP/DLNA or SMB/CIFS or FTP client to get music files from server, UPnP/DLNA client to send audio data to renderer, UPnP/DLNA media server or renderer.
Such functionality is common to music apps in Google Play Store, Apple Store, BlackBerry World.
In most cases such apps can be ported to UWP platform and because they are coming from a POSIX/Linux the network API is 'BSD sockets' as well as some complex network communication libraries can be used to support this or that network-oriented functionality.
Currently the network data flow is boroken once app goes into background or screen is switched off.
It would be useful to have either backgroundNetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundMediaPlayback capability and if playback is active (which can possibly be using network communication) and app is not suspended keep network communication active.

The Default is restricted.
While I understand the idea of the security reasons, it is still nonsense.

Environment:
%AppData%RoamingTestTest.txt
Converted App is following behavior.
1.
Read %AppData%RoamingTestTest.txt.
  centennial runtime create junction point in %AppData%LocalPackagesPkgIdLocalCache folder.
2.
Write %AppData%RoamingTestTest.txt.
  centennial runtime create this instead of junction point.
When I delete %AppData%RoamingTestTest.txt, occur error , error message is "The action can't completed because the file is open in System".
So, centennial runtime locks an original file.

Hello All,
Using the CreateRequestAsync method of UserCertificateEnrollmentManager and CertificateEnrollmentManager classes, I noticed that the CertificatePropertiesCollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage OIDs (for example 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2 (SmartCard Logon), 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 (Secure E-Mail)), basic constraints (like Subject Type=End Entity, or Path Length Constraint=none), nor the Subject Alternative Name (like RFC822, DS Object Guid, ect).
Considering that his may be a feature would require some significate work, could we at least have the ability to specify a Certificate Template name so that we can customize these settings via certificate authority platforms like AD Certificate Authority?

In WPF we had the possibility to have groups within the ComboBox list.
We now have this option for ListView and GridView, but not for the ComboBox control.
For example:

-- Orange (item name)
- Vegetables (group name)
-- Carrot (item name)
-- Cucumber (item name)

In the developer dashboard page there is the option to review and comment on costumer feedback.
This is a very nice capability and thank you for providing it!
Unfortunately, if the gives feedback on your application anonymously there is no option to comment on that feedback or change status etc.
I understand if the comment is anonymous then they will not receive emails on my comments, but it would still be very nice to be able to comment on the feedback and track the status for my own use or for future customers to see if they are perusing previous feedback posts.
So, can you allow us to comment and mark status on anonymous feedback please?
Thanks!

Right now, there is really only one way to serialize a reference to a StorageItem retrieved from a File/FolderPicker, and that's using the StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessList.
The problem is that there is a limit of 1000 items in the FutureAccessList, which can be prohibitive.
For example, an audiobook player app might use the FolderPicker to ask the user to choose where his or her audiobook files are stored (each audiobook might be a collection of MP3 files, for example).
The developer has some underlying class that represents an individual audiobook, with a list of files that make up the book.
Everything is fine up until that point, but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its ID3 tags every time you open the app (which can be a lot of unnecessary work, especially for larger libraries) (or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task), you really don't have many options.
You can add each file that makes up the book to the FutureAccessList, but there could be hundreds of files for a single book, and so you would quickly run out of room in the FutureAccessList to keep track of new books.
The only other option I've come up with for the current APIs is to keep track of the folders that get traversed between the root folder and the file.
Then you can store one folder (the root folder) in the FutureAccessList, and access all of the files in the library by manually calling GetFolderAsync for each link in the chain, then finally calling GetFileAsync for the last step.
Unfortunately, this is very slow, complicated, and requires a lot of extra effort for something that should be a simple scenario.
My proposal is an API out of StorageFolder to retrieve a StorageItem given a relative path from that StorageFolder.
var libraryFolder = await folderPicker.PickSingleFolderAsync();
var file = libraryFolder.GetStorageFileByRelativePath("AuthorNameBookNameFile1.mp3");
var folder = libraryFolder.GetStorageFolderByRelativePath("AuthorNameBookName");
This would allow developers to utilize files and folders more easily without hitting limits related to the FutureAccessList, but still maintain the permissions of the File/FolderPicker paradigm.
If that's not feasible for some reason, I suppose my other thought would be to remove the item count limit on the FutureAccessList, but I get the feeling it's in place for a reason.

Currently, every 30 minutes is the only option for a periodic background agent.
For some use cases, this is not often enough.
But there are also many use cases in which this is excessive and wastes battery.
For example, I have an app installed which uses a live tile to show stock market information.
This tile appears to update periodically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, even though the stock market is only open for  6.5 hours, 5 days a week.
The rest of the time it is just wasting battery life by running.
The app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background, perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day, or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs.
Users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background, so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which aren't.
Some apps may do a lot of background processing, but for a reason that is very useful to the end user.
Furthermore, the 25 second duration should be expanded to at least 60 seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections.

Like ConnectionSettingsTask, this task permit to open Localization Settings Page from application.
This Task is useful for app that use bing map that must check is localization service is active and permit to offer to user an shortcut to edit this setting, like standard Map App.

I would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query 'to-do' items that the app created.

Make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper (representing application )high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui
Now many apps has simply ugly icons,pixelated,Android like ,pirated ,misleading,..

Currently SoftwareBitmapSource is the main way to display programmatically modified images without using Direct2D.
However, the memory usage of SoftwareBitmapSource is currently very prohibitive.
In my testing (using C#), the SoftwareBitmapSource uses twice as much memory as the SoftwareBitmap itself, so you end up with three times the memory of the decompressed image being used.
This seems completely unnecessary.
It ought to be possible for the SoftwareBitmapSource to use the data from the SoftwareBitmap directly and therefore not use any additional memory (except maybe some for rendering to the screen, but this should be small if the size of the rendered image is small).
In addition to this, if both the SoftwareBitmap and SoftwareBitmapSource are created in managed code, then calling the  SoftwareBitmapSource.Dispose() method does not release the memory immediately (and calling both SoftwareBitmapSource.Dispose() and SoftwareBitmap.Dispose() has the same effect).
What I see happening is an amount of memory equal to that used by the SoftwareBitmap is released immediately, then several seconds later the same amount of memory is released, then several seconds later the final same amount of memory is released.
I would expect Dispose() to release memory immediately.
This is an issue when wanting to show one image immediately after another without running out of memory.

Improve Windows Blog Commenting System (and Developer Engagement) with Disqus
This suggestion is for the Windows Blog, and is asking to improve its current commenting system by replacing it with Disqus: https://disqus.com/
Currently the Windows Blog commenting system suffers from a myriad of problems:
- Poor sign-in experience and profile system.
- Static, read-only posts (cannot edit/delete)
- Broken/no notifications
- Buggy / Easy to troll
- No up/down voting
Conversely, with Disqus, you get the following benefits:
- Community within a community (discovery/pollination/profile system)
- Reliable notifications
- Editing / deleting
- Flexible authentication / flagging / difficult to troll
- Up/down voting
A blog post has been created to discuss these issues at length, and you can read that here:
http://blog.developers.win/2016/02/improving-microsoft-developer-engagement-with-disqus/
Adding Disqus to the Windows Blog would be a great way to improve developer engagement and build the Windows Developer community.
Thank you for any consideration and dialogue around this idea!

It would be good to have some pages for wiki, documentation, forum and similar so that everything about the app is reachable from the Store.
Much like a codeplex or sourceforge project.
At the moment every app has its own web site which is rarely visited by users.
This would improve communication between the user and the developers.

Please expose the ID property for Contacts and Appointments.
At the moment it is private (and inaccessible via Reflection because of trust levels), which makes unique contact/appointment identification impossible.
Any application that might want to back-up contact/appointments (and thus would need to differentiate between entities via a unique identifier) cannot exist.
Please take this into consideration and make the ID public (maybe with a new capability requirement).

It is absolutely crazy that I can't use one Microsoft service because I have another Microsoft service.
They actually told me to create a new Microsoft account!

Received from an MVP this week over email:
It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export, or using the files directly as a feed.
This would make it very easy to repeatably test the location data in the device, as well as demo apps for customers.
Other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by Windows Phone.
The NMEA 0183( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 ) is a serial, ASCI, sentence based protocol which is supported by almost all GPS out there now.

I'm missing the ability to change the font name/size and color.
I would like to add the functionality myself or contribut, if somebody could help me.
Thanks

I just found that reading the property of System.Comment from a file doesn't work on Windows 10.
I used StorageFile.Properties.GetDocumentPropertiesAsync() to read the properties of a file that has Comment, but DocumentProperties.Comment is a empty string.
Same problem happens to windows explorer, set a new comment then apply to the file, but when you read again, there's nothing!

tl;dr: Creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.
One possibility:
Instead of having a "top charts" style listing, where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere, create a new form of distribution, where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace.
Now, that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot, so you modify that with ratings.
Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.
For example, my app is currently fairly well reviewed (4.5 stars).
However, it NEVER gets good visibility because it isn't the "best", which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions.
It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts, and waiting to be featured just isn't worth it.
Another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace.
Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see, it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed.
In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.
There are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult, but I feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea, both for developers and for Microsoft.
My two cents.

Soemthing gone wrong in one of the latest builds (currently I'm workong on 14322.1000) and after picking a file or folder the app crashes.
Sometimes it returns for a second but remains inresponsive.
Evertying seemed to work just right few builds before, now many users report me problems.
I've also found that this may be a wider issue: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/dc95d8fe-6a89-42b1-8d07-984cacb42138/uwp-file-and-folder-pickers-do-not-work-on-build-14295?forum=wpdevelop
Also there is a problem with testing suspension when debugging the app from VS - now it's not possible (either it's the problem of VS2015 Update 2 or something with build itself).
It may be connected also with mentioned above picke's problems.
While debugging, if you click suspend the app and VS will hang and after a while your phone will likely restart.

Basic scenario is the need to store set of "secret API keys" for various 3-rd party APIs (twitter, for example).
Just to hardcode API keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered.
There is should be a way to include secure data (as strings or byte[]) remotely at dev center as app setting.
This data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process.
So, application would request secret API keys as needed from system-provided secure storage.
For manual appx test build install on developer device via device portal, test appx should include secret keys inside package.
Release appx shouldn't have secret keys inside, and keys should be on Windows Store server and those keys would be requested from server on application install.
There is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re-publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage.

In some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class.
There must be a way to handle this kind of problem, like statistics on how many times an app was started, or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps.


UWP's Gridview has only Single/Extended/Multiple selection methods.
There is no selection method by mouse rectangle selection, like we select in windows explorer.
i.e.
click-drag to draw a rectangle to select multiple GridView items, using mouse.

We are working on an application that measures the user's productivity by using various sources of data (e.g.
Calendar, GPS, Contacts, Calls history, SMS, Web Browser history, running applications).
Currently, we can collect and process all above data in Android.
In Windows Phone there are many limitations, like for example we don't have any knowledge about running applications.
Please give us ability to run background agent and collect name of the current application in foreground.
It will help us a lot.

Invariably, some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the 1-way nature of the Reviews.
I would like to see a simple change to the "Rate and Review page" near the bottom.
Just add a small text blurb like "If you are experiencing problems with this application, please consider sending feedback instead" along with a link to launch an email to the support email address.
To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.
Set up a brokerage system, whereby the developer never sees the users live email address, and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user.

Currently a lot of developer are asking how to developed Enterprise app in Windows Platform, is that any training kit available?

it would be great to be able to bind / invoke scripts inside a WebView from a ViewModel (like binding a URL to a Property).

I'm currently working on a clock control for my UWP todo-list app 2Day (www.2day-app.com).
I'm creating this control using inspiration from the great Material Design WPF toolkit.
The very early work in progress version is available on my repo: https://github.com/japf/uwp-material-clock
Would you be interesting having this control as part of the UWPCommunityToolkit?
If you think that control could be part of the toolkit, we can start discuss the requirements so that I can submit a PR :-)

It would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app.
If you are unlucky, you might have a bad release or two early on in the lifecycle of the app and receive many 1:s before you can fix the problem.
These low scores will drag down your average for a long time.
The potential downloader is interested in what the app is like *now*, right?

When you choose "Update and shut down" option when an update is available, let it complete everything before shutting down, therefore when I turn on the PC next time everything is already completed and there's nothing else to finish.
I always choose that option at night when I shut down the PC and in the morning I always still have something else unfinished to be updated.

Visual Studio provides a Edit and Continue feature allowing a developer to write code while debugging.
When an exception is thrown and intercepted by the debugger, Edit and Continue permits to change your code right while debugging to make the code continue.
In fact when the debugger is in break mode, you can edit the local function being executed.
Silverlight and Windows Phone does not support that right now.
It would be great to have this feature.

Android gives you the capability to zee how much storage a particular app uses, we could really do with this
After an exercise that caused me to uninstall almost everything it was a little rss reader that was consuming that missing 1gb of space :0(

1. registered javascript witch starts with every page
2. api to add button from this script near address bar
3. api to add menu item into menu

As of now the number of contacts that can be added to a group is restricted to 20, please remove the cap.

This would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector.
There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.
E.g.
imagine a image viewer where you have one group "Folders" and one group "Images".
Folders must of course use a very different item template than Images.
Or you display search results for various item types in one view.
It is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView/GridView.
But it causes a context switch from native-&gt;.net and back for each item, which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).
Plus, as I read in the docs, this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template.
Both problems could be solved by adding GroupStyle.ItemTemplate.
Now the control does not need to call selector for every item, speeding up the control.
And virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group.

Does Windows 10 plan to add path animations in the map.
As I am lead Windows developer for Ola cab service company in India and I am currently implementing custom Path animation of cabs real time movement on map.
But since there is no optimized way to do so hence i have to update pushpin location in every frame.
So would be great if Microsoft things in this way also.

Hi, is it possible to get the active subscription count added in to the console and in to downloadable reports?
We can get the number of acquisitions for IAP but this doesn't tell us about how many are currently active or anything around churn.
It's very difficult to work out how many active subscribers we have.

System supported application error reporting service, that would report back to developers application crashes and details.

Windows Phone 8.1 introduces the Social Extensibility Framework.
It allows third-party apps to integrate into the People Hub's 'What's New' feed, etc.
Currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access.
The documentation on the Windows.Phone.SocialIntegration namespace is also limited.
I would like Microsoft to open up this framework to all developers.
I understand this framework is still being developed and real-word usage must first be measured.
But why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators?
I think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenario's for using this framework.

We're limited at work, since we can't use our mobile devices the way we want...

I recently had to use this API for a private client certificate.
And I was surprised to read in the MSDN that it returns "nothing" as a result of its async call.
I would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx.
So here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this API change would help to improve the code flow:
var clientCert;
ensureCertficatesAsync = function() {
  logger.trace("Checking client certificate");
  if (clientCert) {
    logger.info("Using already loaded client certificate");
    return WinJS.Promise.as(clientCert);
  var certQuery = new Certificates.CertificateQuery();
  certQuery.friendlyName = "Client Cert";
  return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery).then(function(certs) {
    if (!certs.length) {
      return Windows.Storage.StorageFile.getFileFromApplicationUriAsync("ms-appx:///cert/client.pfx");
      }).then(Windows.Storage.FileIO.readBufferAsync).then(function(buffer) {
        var pfx = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.encodeToBase64String(buffer);
        logger.info("Installing client certificate");
        return Certificates.CertificateEnrollmentManager.importPfxDataAsync(
          pfx,
          "XXXXX",
          Certificates.ExportOption.notExportable,
          Certificates.KeyProtectionLevel.noConsent,
          Certificates.InstallOptions.none,
          certQuery.friendlyName
        );
      }).then(function() { // This search in the store could be omitted
        logger.info("Client certificate installed");
        return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery);
      }).then(function(certs) {
        return clientCert = certs[0];
      });
    } else {
      logger.info("Client certificate already installed");
      return clientCert = certs[0];
    }
  });
As you can see after installing the pfx I have to query the store again to fetch the pfx to use it in calls to HttpClient with a filter.
This is not a breaking change.
Current users are not expecting any return in the success continuation, so they not check for any returned value.
Thanks for consideration!

Please provide APIs for detect current keyboard language and information about selected language (LTR or RTL ,...) and provide trigger or event for inform about changing keyboard language

As much as I want to use WinJS to build apps for Windows and Windows Phone, the complete lack of unit testing tools has turned me off of the platform.
Right now it's impossible to automate unit testing a WinJS application.
Instead we have to either create a second WinJS project  and link all of our source files to it, or add a special page into the app itself that's dedicated to unit testing.
These options are far from ideal.
I propose you add a proper unit test suite for the WinJS platform that can be automated and ideally run from common JavaScript tools like Grunt.

You should officially support Windows Template Library (WTL) and make it the first class native Windows API framework, replacing the aging MFC.

Before UWP, CurrentCulture reflected the Regional Settings format and CurrentUICulture reflected the Display Language.
That behavior is good but has changed in UWP (both now reflect the same thing: Display Language), making it unecessarely hard for developers to correctly respect the user's preference when displaying dates and numbers.
This behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the SDK to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format.
We shouln't have to relly on workaround like this one: https://www.pedrolamas.com/2015/11/02/cultureinfo-changes-in-uwp/

When I'm switching from my Ubuntu to Windows, I often keep attempting to do this Primary Selection style copy/paste.
It really annoys me it doesn't work, and kills the productivity.
As you can tell, I'm bothered with this to a point I'm here at the uservoice.
I'd really love to see it added.

Add a tile view like in old Windows 8.1 Store.
It was great to see at a glance rating, money generated by the application...

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.core.preview.systemnavigationmanagerpreview.closerequested
The document said that `Occurs when the user invokes the system button for close (the 'x' button in the corner of the app's title bar).`
But when user tapping 'x' button on Sets window ( https://i.imgur.com/WZiITQ6.png ), the event not raised correctly.

When using CameraCaptureUI for capturing photo in app, after capturing photo you can see there are some strange line in photo.
You reproduce this on Mobile, Build 14393 system.

After the anniversary update the store shows default the ratings of "Current version".
This is very annoying for developers of good and populair apps.
A potential user viewing in the store will most likely make his judgement to download based on the number of reviews and quality of reviews (especially since the windows store does not show the total number of downloads).
After every update the default for current version will be reset to 0.
So for app publishers this will be a reason to keep app updates to an absolute minimum in order to get as many ratings as possible.
So please make "All versions" the default.
Or at least "Last 30 days".
And also remember the preferred setting of the user.

There are situations in which it's necessary to securely store sensitive credentials but having them roam across devices is undesirable.
On iOS, this can be done by creating a keychain item with the attribute kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly.
On Windows, there does not appear to be a way to add a PasswordCredential object to the PasswordVault with roaming disabled.

Currently the Win2D DirectionalBlurEffect is marked as [NoComposition] and can't be used with Composition APIs both in the Creator's Update and the new insider builds for the Fall Creator's Update.
Since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole "motion" theme of the Fluent Design System, I think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other Composition APIs to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment.
Thanks!

I have an app where I use a custom title bar by extending my view into the title bar area:
CoreApplication.GetCurrentView().TitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar = true;
Then I also use code like this to allow a custom element to support dragging of the window:
Window.Current.SetTitleBar(gripper);
This all was implemented pre-Anniversary Update.
While all this works fine, a bug was introduced in the Anniversary Update where the title bar returns zero for Height, SystemOverlayRightInset, and SystemOverlayLeftInset now.
A custom title bar like mine relies on those values being filled in so that we can "avoid" putting content under the title bar buttons and can also ensure that our other UI appears under the title bar height.
I confirmed that in pre-Anniversary Update, these properties would return values like 32 for Height and 188 for SystemOverlayRightInset.
Please fix this bug that was introduced in Anniversary Update since there is no other way to get title bar metrics that I know of.
It seems like the whole point of the CoreApplicationViewTitleBar class is to supply that data.

For some reason, entering a number with a * at the front in to the dialler task in an app in WP7.5, WP8.0, or WP8.1 results in the message "Please enter service codes directly from the phone's keypad".
This means I can't use GSM service codes in a dialler app, e.g.
for settings conditional call forwarding which needs *61* at the front.

My original account expired and I was forced to create a new account when I decided to enroll again.
However, since the original account is tied to my Microsoft Id (which is used everywhere else!)
it is now a pain to log into Dev Center.
In fact, how does one do it?
When I navigate here I am connected via the expired account.
But logging out and back in is no good since I am not asked which account I want to use.

Include a RateMyApp for UWP control similar to RateMyApp control released by Nokia for Windows Phone 8.
This make it easy to implement and obtain rating.Saves time and can focus on app logic as opposed to mundane tasks.

Helloxefxbcx8c I had verified the Desktop Bridge Email several days ago , but now I has no reach out other emailxefxbcx8c I try to submission my converted app to store , but get errors like that :
Package acceptance validation error: You don't have permissions to specify the following namespaces in the appx manifest file of the package QYPlayer_1.1.0.0_x86.appx: http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities
next what I need to do ?

I would like to see the metadata be part of the project in VS.
This would allow (as others have suggested) a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks.
An editor (like properties/settings) would be great.

I have an app listed on the store here
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/deskrule-desktop-search-engine/9nblggh43z1v
it is declared as "free to try" but prospective users just see a big BUY button, and to get the free trial they have to hunt for the [xe2x80xa6] button and its menu.
I am sure this limits the # of people willing to try the app!
The default action button for free to try apps should be DOWNLOAD FREE TRIAL instead of "buy"

This function used to return the correct debug screen on Windows Phone 7 emulator, but it returns a buffer full of 0xffffffff values when executing it under Windows Phone 8 emulator.

Microsoft should re-enable the Windows Bridge for Android.
This way we could access to all the android apps that are not currently getting ported over.
This could allow apps that Microsoft developed specifically for Android be released in the Windows store

we are publishing the same apps in Windows Phone Store and Windows App Store.
Now we want to bundle these Apps.
Unfortunately we are not able to set the prices in both marketplace same way.
In Windows App Store we can choose the price tier.
For all countries prices are automatically set.
In Windows Phone Store we are able to set the price for each county separately.
We need this also in Windows App Store because:
1.
Exchange rate between US$ and xe2x82xac is too low.
The rate is set to 1-1.
Because we calculate our prices in xe2x82xac we have to change the $ price for all countries with $ manually and there are a lot of countries to change.
We are not willing to charge less in US or Canada than in Europe
2.
Change exchange rate between Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa.
The rates are too low, so we have set the values manually
3.
Checkbox to add additional fee of 13.9% on top of the normal Store Fee (percentage of Net Receipts) that is deducted in calculating our  Application Proceeds for these markets: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa.
This fee applies only to alternative payment methods (e.g.
carrier billing) and not to credit card transactions in Windows Phone Store

Windows Runtime is a great platform, but it lacks some really basic things.
One of those basic things is public class inheritance.
Windows Runtime should allow public non-sealed classes.
This is already implemented for XAML classes, now this should be available for all Windows Runtime components.
You could also consider implementing this partially: for example, allow inheritance only between managed WinRT classes, and deriving managed classes from native WinRT classes.

I saw that ImageEx's fade animation doesn't allow developers to change duration and fixed to one second.
It'd be great to add that feature since not all developers want a transition that long and to be honest, it makes the app look slower.
For example, FadeAnimationDuration = "0:0:0.33"

see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33615542/error-not-enough-storage-using-fileloggingsession
Writing to a FileLoggingSession that has a LgoFileGenerated event atttached via a LoggingChannel in a loop without pausing throw exception "Not enough storage".

RS5 preview has been out for a week or so, but only for real hardware.
It'd be really nice to have emulator preview builds as well.

Allow developers to alter/edit an applications metadata, including description, images/graphics, pricing and keywords etc... once the app is published without resubmitting.
This would make bug fixes to spelling and screeshots simple &amp; would save Microsoft from having to test submissions for Metadata only.

Let people inherit from EasingFunctionBase, because Microsoft, you do not have infinite wisdom, and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesn't have the one I need.
In WPF you could inherit from this class to make your own.
Please allow this in winRT!
This is such a simple addition it's not even funny.
It would probably take about two minutes to code this feature in.

In DX11 you can't read and write to the same texture, and that's fine, I can live with that.
However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.
Say I have 100 objects to draw.
These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.
Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP)
And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM)
Both SP and TM use alpha blending.
SP don't do depth writes, but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.
Depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels, and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity (to make them soft).
TM do depth writes and depth tests, but they don't do depth reads in the shader.
By depth writes I mean the D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask
So both SP and TM do legal operations (they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time)
However in the worst case, when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:
SP, TM, SP, TM, SP, TM, ..
I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled.
Remember that sorting has to be done by the distance to camera, and can't be done by state changes.
So in order to draw them all, I have to do:
for(Int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) // for each object
    D3DC-&gt;OMSetRenderTargets(..ID3D11DepthStencilView that either has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled);
    set depth writes enabled or disabled, set other state changes, make the draw call
To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation, but I need to call it 100 times.
And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless, because the same depth texture is used, just with a different view, and because both SP and TM do legal operations, they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time.
In my opinion the D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH is really useless, and should be removed, any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask in each draw call.
However to don't sacrifice performance, those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode "D3D-&gt;SetExceptionMode(D3D11_RAISE_FLAG_DRIVER_INTERNAL_ERROR)", and in that case, the draw call should still be allowed, but it only should issue a debug warning: "writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results"
Inside the OMSetRenderTargets you have code to automatically unbind textures that are bound as render targets from shader inputs, that code should be removed as well.
You should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own, without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance.
That way would be very beneficial:
-I don't need to create 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer (one with D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled and one with disabled)
-I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.
But I just stick to normal depth writes D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask
This would result in smaller memory usage, faster performance, smaller cpu overhead / power usage, longer battery life.
This artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in Chrome/FireFox:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=763695
Once you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge, you will notice that you will encounter the same problem, because in GLES3/WebGL2 it's legal to read from the depth texture while it's bound to the FBO, and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH or no.
You will don't have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from DX11 API.
Thank you

Create an api that takes as an argument a command as a STRING.
And using that string the api may activate the command, like cortana does when you say "Hey cortana ", MY COMMAND, but without voice interaction.
For example: If i want to shut down, or take a photo, or search for dolphins, or want to show the weather to the user, or whatever, from the uwp app itself.
This way the app is very robust and flexible.
Offcourse the api can throw CommandNotFoundException.
Cortana must already do that, after it "understands" the text, but i want to expose the api that does what happens next.

Make it so that a meteo style app would only need to adapt its UI to run on Windows phone.
It would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered.

Every modern operating system on this planet uses LF style line endings, except for Windows, which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line.
It is time for a change!
Switch the default to LF style line endings in the whole operating system!

This would make replying to messages, etc.
from an accessory device (like a smartwatch) possible.

Right now, the new DevCenter offers the ability to sort by apps by Included, Markets, Base-price and Last modified.
It would be more useful to be able to sort by Reviews, Acquisitions, Crashes and Ratings.

Side Loaded Apps - Full kernel driver access.

I have a wp8.0 game and decided to update it to wp8.1.
Technically everything went smoothly but when I tried to submit the update it required that I reserved a name.
I thought "fine, I'll just reserve the existing name because I've build a fan base around it".
Then all hell broke loose: The name had been reserved by someone else!
!
I went to the wp store and searched for the name and it only showed my app, no other app.
Went to the windows store, same thing.
Someone had reserved the name of a game that has been in the store for months with seemingly no intention of releasing an app!
I had chat with Microsoft support, twice, to no avail.
You are only covered if you have a copyright for that name.
Most small developers do not.
So how can this issue be avoided?
Several suggestions:
- First and foremost (this should had already been implemented):  Automatic reservation for existing apps when there is only one app with that name.
- Reduce the reservation period from 1 year to 3 months.
- Do not allow the same publisher from reserving the same name more than once per year.
I have two options: Either I'm stuck forever on wp8.0 and unable to update the game or update the game to wp8.1 and lose the fan base that I so hard struggled to create all these months.


I have a driver causing a memory leak.
Microsoft's official support reccomends that I use a tool called poolmon to find which driver is causing the leak.
Poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool, and only as part of the Windows Driver Kit, so I must download the entire Windows Driver Kit to access this one small tool.
In order to download the Windows Driver Kit, I must first install Visual Studio 2017.
I am not going to download multiple GBs of **** that I will never use to fix a memory leak.
That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard-drive bloat issue.
What a joke.
Thanks for nothing, Microsoft.

Now that Microsoft has bought Xamarin, integrated it in Visual Studio and made it free, it would be awesome to replace Xamarin.Forms Xaml syntax with current UWP so that Devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as RelativePanel, x:Bind, Adaptive Triggers, Live Visual Tree etc and also no learning curve for Xamarin.Forms-specific naming conventions (e.g StackLayout instead of StackPanel)

DataPackage.OperationCompleted is not raised (at least when pasting text).
This is contrary to the docs, and to expected behavior.

Make it really smooth to update code of a UWP app.
Like you are already doing with the XAML part, the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched.
It could be really good to hot reload the app when changing C# or XAML code.
It could save us (developers) a lot of time.

The ability to give a contact to another WP7 user is of value, especially between me and my wife.
I pick up a contact we both know, I'd like to be able to push it to her phone.


We live in a connected world.
And I have a connected app that benefits from fast, low latency networks, but can work with a larger buffer, if need be.
It would be really cool if I could open a TCP/IP socket, and by listening to the raw transmissions and re-send events, determine how "good" the network quality is.
It would be even better if I could have an API that could make the calculations for me, and offer up a packet failure/retransmission percent, or average time between send and acknowledgment.

We can access exif info (limited) using a Picture object when dealing with Media library.
But if we try to save an Image within app inside Media library or some Isolated storage we can't prserve exif info of that image.
A better manipulation of exif APIs will be very helpfull.

A lot of small time developers like myself don't have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps.
I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they're doing.
I would really like to switch to UWP for development, however, I'm not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win32 apps wouldn't have any problem just downloading from a network drive.
Win32 apps still dominate because they're so robust and developed.
To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms.

My idea is simply to double the clipboard capabilities to improve user efficiency.
The 4 options should be made available on the context menu when highlighting a text or item.
For example;
Copy 1 [Item A]
Copy 2 [Item B]
Paste 1 [Item A]
Paste 2 [Item B]
The commands could be changed to colours, rather than numerical values.
E.g.
Copy &lt;blue&gt; Paste &lt;blue&gt;
Copy &lt;Green&gt; Paste &lt;Green&gt;

Now that beta apps do not expire, we, the developers need a way to force remove a beta app from devices or remove access for certain users.
Please provide us a way via the Dev Center to force the expiration of the beta app for all, or for certain users.

There is a very high demand from the users of media applications on Windows 10 to have support of DVD and BLU-RAY playback in the media apps, and currently there is no API which can be used to support that in a uwp app.
As a developer I would really appreciate if such an API feature is created for uwp SDK.

Currently the only country that is available as a supported country from Africa in pub centre is South Africa.
Please make it available also for us developers here in Kenya

Enterprise feature

this feature is very annoying as it keeps changing my words for me and i don't want that.
after every 3 words or so my phone will put the first letter into a capitol and words such as go and others it just puts it completely into capitols, this is soo annoying and getting on my nerves, pls fix/allow for more settings for this asap

Tombstoning and FAS paradigms are non-trivial to many new WP7 developers and error prone due to many developers not understanding it completely.
Few MS blog entries ( http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ptorr/archive/2011/03/21/i-was-joking-about-the-penny-but-how-about-some-tombstoning-sample-code.aspx , http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ptorr/archive/2010/12/11/how-to-correctly-handle-application-deactivation-and-reactivation.aspx ) and MSDN documentation help to explain how to write applications that work well in case of Tombstoning too.
FAS reduces the changes of applications Tombstoning but it still needs to be handled.
It will be helpful for many developers if a few sample new project templates which show when and where variables can be created, instantiated so that better app experiences can be given to users.

Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread (for example "Reveal highlight" effect while bigger page is loading, or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running)

I changed the windows firewall default to block anything without a rule.
This is so ridiculous that windows update doesn't have any rule and there is no way (believe me I googled a lot) to allow it securely (without allowing whole svhost.exe) even spotify has a default rule!

I'm using lates windows 10 edition (build 1709)
I have added this whole ASN (AS8075 https://ipinfo.io/AS8075) to my windows firewall but after that it can only check that there is an update but for downloading it tried to connect to some akami IPs (according to windows firewall logs)

There is no way for adding dns names in windows firewall and also it is not secure.

I already tried renaming svhost.exe with no luck.
Please add windows update to default rules!!

Right now, RichEditBox only supports input and output in RTF format.
Please add few enhancements so it accepts HTML also or add a converter which may help developers.

Please provide full access to the ContactStore, eg, updating, deleting etc.
Also if I create a contact in the ContactStore then search contacts it returns the ones ive created, but there is no extended properties that will enable me to know ive created it in my custom store.
So please provide this extra info in the Contact data returned with a search.

We can open a pdf in webview by html file.But we cannot open pdf file from a url with .dpf extension.

Sideloading is far to complex!
Try sideloading an enterprise app for all users...
Don't botter fixing this, I advise the company to switch to android for 'apps anyway' (hint sideloading on android works like a breeze).

Microsoft Support recommended me to post the issue here.
There seems to be a long-standing serious issue with the Store (or possibly the dev portal) which needs to be addressed urgently.
There's a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed.
The problem starts after a certain app update.
The symptoms are as stated in the title.
Certain users who had installed the app prior to the problematic update are affected.
Fresh users are not affected by this issue.
While it is possible to reinstall the app via windowsphone.com, users who had previously owned the app now lost their license.
These users are now required to buy the app again to own the app.
Speculation: It appears to me that the Store is seeing the update as a "new" app and therefore the original certificate is no longer recognized -- thereby triggering the symptoms above.
Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back-end systems.
Also, we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app.
The issue gets complicated when the users owned the app via a free promo and Support may not be willing to restore the purchase using this method.
Feel free to contact me if further info is required.
Thank you.

Notepad has been updated to support Line endings from Unix, Linux, and Mac.
I think we should take it one step further and make Notepad opensource like Powershell so the open-source community can continue to add features to Notepad to become the go-to text editor for performing quick edits of programming.

Apps may need files they are writing to as well (in my case: configuration data).
At the moment it is possible to install to the application install directory, but the files there cannot be altered by the application.
If the application copies the files to the application data folder after installation, as done in my work around, it cannot delete the original files in the installation folder, by this having two versions.
An example is in VS I have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the.

Get ride of the extra clicks required to actually change the state of the checkbox embedded in a DataGridCheckBoxColumn.
It seems that as a result we all end up using a Checkbox in a CellTemplate, making DataGridCheckBoxColumn useless.

Please add a "Windows 10 Apps" category to this UserVoice.
When drag/dropping files/folders onto Universal Apps, the read-only attribute is set, making it impossible to edit those files/folders.
There should be a way, e.g.
through manifest, to allow this kind of interaction.
After all, drag/drop is a conscious user interaction (like a picker) and does not happen without their knowledge.

For me personally, it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting/updating my app, rather than having to provide a URL, so I think this should be an option.
If a URL is required, then either I have to use something like OneDrive which I think looks a bit unprofessional, or I have to create a web page which requires hosting etc, and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember.
I would prefer it if everything to do with my app could be contained with in the dev center/store.

Currently, the ScrollViewer's content can be overpanned.
Since we are preparing a custom control with the ScrollViewer, the look and feel is not nice.
It would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in ScrollViewer with an API or with any other option to disable it.

Windows dashboard, having the upload speed adjusted so that developers with slower internet connections (384kbps) can upload packages.
Refer the  case number was 1267384558.

The WNS currently does not seem to support loc-key, loc-args APNS equivalents.
I believe we can currently send "ms-resource:foo" for the loc-key, but it still doesn't let us do any simple string operations on it (like replacing indexed placeholders in the string).
As a result, all of the notification strings have to be generated server-side iterating for all the languages supported by the client (like https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/notification-hubs-ios-xplat-localized-apns-push-notification/)  .
This causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case, while APNS / GCM provide a single cohesive story.
This gets even more painful when we work with client-application teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a loc-key, loc-args contract.

Some countries have unstable local currency and it will be better to get payouts not in local currency.
For example Rubles get down on ~50% compared to USD after 4 months at the end of 2014.
Therefore devs in Russia will loose about 50% of their income.

Currently you cannot create an Emitter unless you are using 48K Wave audio.
Back in DirectSound, you could do L/R panning with any Wave sample-rate.
One of the benefits of migrating to AudioGraph is support for mp3 &amp; other files, but if you want do panning, you still have to convert them first.
Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode, panning other file formats could be supported?

Hello Dev Team!
If it possible please allow/make mobileBroadband management in Radio class.

Allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals

Allow applications to register messaging endpoints on device [e.g.
register as a launcher/chooser] to ease on-device inter-application communication

Reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day.
It would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at "X" hours

Desktop App Converter] constantly fails with the E_CREATING_ISOLATED_ENV_FAILED error.
The inner exception that has sense is the "System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException".
Inner Exception[3]:

I looked through the GUID-named folder and found no "SHARED" folder inside.
So, no contents of MyApp and no KnownFolderDump.exe.
The "dac" folder exists, but under "output", not under "shared".
And the "dac" folder is empty.
The question is how to fix that?
The problem occurs on every conversion.
PS: I cannot try to create the folders in advance because each time the converter generates and uses a new GUID.
I tried three different installers (InnoSetup, a plain self-extracting archive produced by 7zip, and VLC Media Player from the video tutorial by Avneet Singh and David Tepper).

The Acquisitions Funnel in the new Windows Developer Center dashboard is cool, but the rectangular bars representing each stage of the funnel are incorrect.
For example, I have a 25% conversion rate between Store page views and downloads, but the second bar is only 5% the width of the first bar (should be ~25%).
